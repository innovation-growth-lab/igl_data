0,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South African FIFA presidential candidate Tokyo Sexwale said on Monday he is a realist who is “open to negotiations and alliances” ahead of Friday’s vote in Zurich. Sexwale, whose campaign has failed to gain traction, is the first candidate in the process to suggest he could be interested in striking a deal. The millionaire businessman is up against Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, former FIFA deputy general secretary Jerome Champagne, Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein and UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino in the race to become head of world soccer’s governing body. FIFA is embroiled in a corruption scandal that has led to indictments against several dozen senior officials in the United States.

The two-year yield and the 10-year yield were unchanged at minus 0.160% and minus 0.050%, respectively. The 30-year yield was also flat, at 0.540%. The Bank of Japan on Tuesday offered to buy 1.23 trillion yen ($11.16 billion) of one- to 10-year JGBs as part of a regular operation. The Nikkei was little changed and unable to provide the JGB market with incentives.

The French finance minister said differences should be resolved ""through means other than threats.""Trump's move marks something of a change in tone for the president, who has spent weeks attacking America's biggest tech firms.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.US President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into French plans to slam big tech companies, like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook, with giant new taxes.The probe, known as a Section 301 investigation, was announced Wednesday night by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. It could culminate in retaliatory tariffs, which might open up a new trade war.France's digital-services tax, which was approved by the French Senate on Thursday, would require tech firms with revenue of more than $845 million to pay a 3% tax on their French sales.This could raise about €500 million, or $563 million, for the French public purse every year, which French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has said would amount to ""justice.""Taxing revenue is meant to counter the complex arrangements most US tech firms have in place to avoid paying high taxes on their profits.Lighthizer's office said it had reason to believe that France was ""unfairly targeting the tax"" on US companies. As a result, Trump has called for the investigation.Read more: Tech's tax bombshell: Internet giants face billions more in taxes in Europe as regulators demand 'justice'""The United States is very concerned that the digital-services tax which is expected to pass the French Senate tomorrow unfairly targets American companies,"" Lighthizer said Wednesday.""The president has directed that we investigate the effects of this legislation and determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.""







The US has the authority to ""respond to a foreign country's unfair trade practices"" under the trade act, Lighthizer's office said, suggesting it could decide to hit back at the French tax.Action against Europe would not be unprecedented for the US president, who imposed tariffs of 25% on European steel and 10% on aluminum in May last year. The US is also fighting a trade war with China, and trade tensions are brewing between the US and India.""Trump preps for a trade war with France,"" was the conclusion of the New York Times economic-policy reporter Alan Rappeport.Le Maire on Thursday said threats for the US were not the answer. ""I profoundly believe that between allies we can and should resolve our differences through means other than threats,"" he said, per Reuters.""France is a sovereign country which makes sovereign decisions about its tax regime and it will continue to make sovereign decisions about its tax regime.""UK plans almost identical taxFrance's digital-services tax could be seen as a test case for other European countries to introduce similar tax regimes. The UK, for example, has announced an almost identical plan, which Boris Johnson, the likely next UK prime minister, has indicated his support for.Trump's call for an investigation marks a change in tone for the president, who has spent weeks accusing America's biggest tech firms of bias against conservatives bias and hinting at antitrust grievances. He has even threatened to sue firms like Google and Facebook."
6,"Juiced by tax cuts this year, the economy's performance peaked in the second quarter and is expected to increasingly lose steam in 2019, with growth slowing to a crawl and a recession looming. That is one big reason the stock market has spiraled lower, as buyers rushed into Treasurys and yields on corporate debt snapped higher. Investors' views, in fact, may be even gloomier than those of economists. Major firms this week have been releasing forecasts for next year, and both Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan see growth slowing to below 2 percent in the second half of 2019. But at the same time, the two firms expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates four times, while other economists believe the Fed may have to move at a slower pace. Economists point to a number of factors for the slower growth, but topping the list of scare factors for markets are those Fed interest rate hikes as well as the impact of tariffs and trade wars, should they continue. Economists do not foresee a recession next year, but by 2020, one seems more likely, some economists said. ""It depends on the Fed. If they continue along the current [interest rate hiking] trajectory they are following ... I think [there's a recession in] the first half of 2020,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist Americas at Natixis. LaVorgna expects 2.5 percent growth next year, though slower in the second half. Stock prices are now flat for the year, after a near 9 percent decline in the S&P 500 since September. More than 40 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 have seen at least a 20 percent decline, reaching bear market levels. At the same time, credit spreads have widened in both the high yield and investment grade corporate to 2016 levels. ""Look at how much things have tightened,"" said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. ""If you look around the globe, there's been a slowdown in money growth and a rise in yields all around the globe, and typically when you tighten like that, this is what happens. ... You're starting to see more evidence of it in the home builders' survey, the housing numbers, the auto sales, the durable goods numbers."" Watch: How the Fed could cause the next recession, according to Gary Shilling The fear is also feeding on itself with concerns that worsening financial conditions could add to slower growth but possibly hold back the Fed's rate hikes. ""This market to me now is telling you that investor recession fears are escalating. Whether that's right or not, I still lean toward the view we're going to avoid it, but we're going to be really scared of it. I think we're going to break the previous lows, and be scared to death that either the bull market is over or a recession is here, and that might be a good opportunity to buy,"" said Paulsen. Economists, however, are not convinced a recession is in the cards until at least 2020, and the sluggish growth basically returns to the normal pace of slow but steady growth for the years prior to 2018. Growth was just around 2 percent in seven of the last 11 quarters, with the exceptions including the peak of 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2018. ""Everything points to a slowdown next year. Rising mortgage rates hurting housing construction. Business orders on equipment stalled out. Consumers don't have as much tax cut money to spend. Everything points to a slowdown, but the economy was pretty strong, so it's going to be slowing from what? I think it's going to be about 3.2 percent this year if we get 3 percent in the fourth quarter,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. Rupkey sees 2.7 percent growth in 2019. But the average forecast for a group of 10 economists, including the Fed, was 2.4 percent for 2019, according to a CNBC survey. ""We're looking at growth a little above 2 percent, 2.25 percent,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. ""It's not super strong, but it should still whittle away at the unemployment rate. The most difficult thing for financial markets is what's happening to margins. The cushion provided by tax cuts on year over year has disappeared."" Swonk said she expects a recession in the second half of 2020, in part because of the collateral damage from trade wars.  Economists say one of the big factors bringing growth back to its pre-tax-cut pace is simply the fading of the positive boost from tax cuts, and that should be clear in corporate profit growth, expected at about 8.5 percent for the S&P 500, down from about 24 percent in 2018. Rupkey said there are signs that business spending, boosted by tax cuts, is also topping out. For instance, durable goods orders for October fell an unexpected 4.4 percent, due in part to a reversal in transportation equipment which had strong gains in August and September. Inside the number, the proxy for business spending, the nondefense capital goods orders ex-aircraft, was flat. ""It gets up to about $70 billion per month and then kind of stalls out there. I think it stalled out. It certainly stopped for now,"" Rupkey said. ""There's just no further driver for the economy coming from investment in equipment. They've ordered all their equipment for now. Trade is partly [a factor] in there."" Rupkey said he is keeping his forecast of 3 percent for the fourth quarter but risks are on the downside. His forecast for next year does not anticipate an escalation of trade wars or tariffs, as anticipated in the forecasts of some of the other economists. ""If the President is thinking of cutting a deal with China at G20 in Buenos Aires, now would be the time,"" Rupkey noted. President Donald Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of next week. That meeting could set the tone for markets but also for how the economy performs if he is to proceed with higher or additional tariffs. ""There is some worry about what's going on with China and what the world growth picture is like now,"" said Rupkey. Economists note that the slowdown in China has ripples across the emerging world and into Europe. ""I see Europe weakening,"" said Swonk. ""I don't think Europe is prepared for a slowdown in China. There's a lot of risks we don't fully understand in the system."" The U.S. economy had been the standout in the past year, with the economy diverging from others, but the loss of the tax cut benefit combined with tariff impacts could now be a double whammy. As of Jan. 1, the tariffs on Chinese goods could rise to 25 percent from 10 percent, and Trump has threatened another $250 billion or so in Chinese goods could be subject to tariffs. ""We had these competitive policies where tax cuts were widening margins, and at the same time we were losing margins to tariffs and rising wages, and now they all go in the same direction,"" said Swonk. ""Financial markets are uncertain about what will show up in price increases."" Economists expect companies to try to pass on the impact of rising tariffs through higher prices, but they may not be able to do so. ""Next year, if 25 percent tariffs go through on Chinese imports, that would amount to a tax increase of over $100 billion, much of which would fall on the consumer,"" J.P. Morgan economists noted. They expect the impact to be either absorbed through currency adjustments or in the margins of both Chinese and U.S. producers. LaVorgna said the tax cuts could bite for another reason, in that some taxpayers may find they have not withheld enough to cover their taxes with the new tax bill and could have to pay more in April. LaVorgna said that could add to weakness in the second half of 2019. ""It's weaker for a few reasons, some of which is the delayed affect of higher interest rates which is certainly slowing housing and perhaps a tightening of fiscal policy, and not because of what you think,"" said LaVorgna. He said individuals in high-tax states could be the most impacted. ""You could wind up having a pretty significant tax increase for people where they owe more than expected."" Housing is one place investors have been watching, for fear it is signaling a consumer slowdown. As interest rates have risen, homebuyers have increasingly stepped back, and mortgage applications, including refinancings, were 22 percent below last year's level in the last week. Homebuilder sentiment in November fell to its lowest level in two years, in its steepest one-month drop in 4 1/2 years. ""It's a canary in the coal mine. It can respond to interest rates a year-and-a-half before the rest of the economy,"" said Diane Swonk. She said the current housing market is not the bubble it was before the financial crisis. ""Much more of the debt is safer than it was. The problem is what's being issued now to keep the market going. It's not a systemic problem. It's a signal you want to watch. We hope it's a yellow flag, not a red flag."" Existing home sales for October were up an unexpected 1.4 percent. ""We look for only a modest decline in residential investment,"" the J.P. Morgan economists noted. For the first three quarters of 2018, they note that real residential investment declined 2.9 percent on an annualized basis and should continue to decline into 2019. They expect the drag from higher rates to fade, and housing activity should improve again."
7,"Mascots are a special, yet often overlooked, component of the Olympics.  Since 1968, a cute creature has been designed for each of the games and plastered all over merchandise. In the grand internet tradition of ranking things, it's only fitting that we examine the strengths and weaknesses of some of the most beloved Olympic mascots and see how they stack up.  I'm Izz-AY and I'm here to part-AY Izzy is here for one reason and one reason only: to party. Though he was apparently selected by a group of children, Izzy looks more like he belongs in the halls of a frat house.   Childlike, yet terrifying Magique could be a whole lot worse, but he could also be a whole lot better. For the most part, any mascot that's not explicitly an animal tends to look incredibly creepy, and nothing exemplifies that so much as Magique's little flesh-colored head popping out from his star-shaped body.   I'm Schneeman, and I like warm hugs! In German, Schneeman translates to ""snowman,"" but Olaf's less put-together counterpart looks less like a ""snowman"" and more like a ""possessed snowball."" The oddly humanoid hands and soulless black eyes really complete the look.   He could be right out of a Doctor Who episode. I'm still not sure what Wenlock is supposed to be, even after reading the IOC's description of him as being ""made from one of the last drops of steel used to build the Olympic Stadium in London."" Wenlock looks less like a fun mascot and more like he wants to be our new overlord.  ""Come play with us..."" Out of the pairs of childlike creatures on this list, Haakon and Kristin are definitely the most realistic, which honestly makes them all the more haunting. These little children look like they belong in a Stephen King movie and they really, really want to play...  Hmm. Their design would be much better if they weren't so yellow. From a distance, they resemble sentient bananas. Up close, the truth is more terrifying. And in giant form, these fellas straight up look like they're going to hunt you down.   He is valid. Schuss gets major points for being the OG mascot. That being said, his design is still a little on the weirdly terrifying end. Though he has an endearingly wholesome quality that lands him higher up on the list.   It's all in the eyes. I was originally inclined to put these guys pretty close to the top, because they look very cute when rendered in 2D. But after doing more research, I found their true 3D forms, which are basically nightmare fuel. Sorry, guys.  Rocket the racoon's alter-ego Roni is a raccoon decked out in ski gear. There's really not much else to be said for him. There's nothing about his design that is especially scary, but there's nothing about it that stands out either. Good on you, Roni.   CooooOOoookie Crisp — oh wait Vučko looks like he could be on a box of cereal, screaming at small children, or chasing an annoying bird across a desert landscape. He's not though, he just looks like every other cartoon attempt to make wolves or coyotes more friendly and approachable (because stealing cereal from children and hunting roadrunners is cute.)   I wonder what country he's from. There's nothing technically wrong with Sam, except that he's the most generic American mascot design you could come up with. He's an American bald eagle wearing an American hat with an American bow tie, because lest we forget, he is an American mascot.   Welcome to Calgary, eh! The Canadian equivalent of Sam features two bears (for Canada!) decked out in frontier wear. Hidy and Howdy rank higher than Sam because bears are objectively cuddlier than eagles. They have all the friendliness that we associate with Canadians, coupled with the reminder that Canada is damn cold.   This is a bear. When you think Russia, you think bear. Misha is one such bear. His design is very bear. The most bear. There is nothing lacking about Misha. He simply is bear. Misha ranks above Hidy and Howdy, though, because his costume attire is just a cool belt and not an over-the-top ensemble.  They're gonna hit Outback Steakhouse later. There's nothing wrong with this trio, except that they're the most generic Australian animals we could've come up with: a platypus, a kookaburra and a — well, I guess the echidna's cool. They get a leg up over the other generic animal mascots because Australian animals are more interesting by default.  Just slightly cuter than they are creepy. Neve and Gliz show us how to do humanoid-duo without making it too creepy. They are still a little creepy, but because they're so cartoonish, they're far off from falling into the eerie ""Uncanny Valley.""  Look at these wee owl bebs More commonly known as the ""Snowlets,"" these little birdies have all the perks of an appealing design: round shape, bright colors, big eyes. It's the weird smile underneath the beak that bumps them down, but they're still precious little darlings.   They also come in early 2000s snowboard-bro gear A bear, hare, and coyote could cross the line into stereotypical, but there's a deeper choice behind this selection. Each animal in this trio is heavily featured in local Native American stories and each wears a necklace with a petroglyph (rock engraving) in the style of the ancient people of the area, the Anasazis and the Fremonts. So even though the choice seems basic, they get points for a cooler meaning.   Tony the Tiger's Korean cousin Strong, dignified Hodori represents Korea without being obvious about it. Unlike 2018's mascot, Hodori lacks an element of cuteness, but he still shines with positivity and a can-do attitude. He wears a sangmo, a traditional Korean hat, to honor his roots.   Dogs are objectively cuter in suits. Cobi's design was met with mixed reviews when he was first unveiled. Considering he's supposed to be a Pyrenean mountain dog and this design does not exactly scream ""Pyrenean mountain dog,"" I can see where the confusion came from. But his dynamic Cubist-inspired design really sets Cobi apart from the other mascots, without compromising his cuddliness factor.   The new Fab Five This mascot quintet sparkles with cuteness and with symbolism. Each of the five represents a different traditional Chinese element and a different wish: prosperity, happiness, health, luck, and passion for sport. It's a traditional approach that combines with the modern Olympic creed, giving these cute mascots some depth.   A strong boi Sturdy, yet minimalist, Amik is a mascot you can depend on. It's a beaver, which is very obviously Canadian, but Amik's design is sophisticated enough to transcend geography. With Amik they took the obvious choice and turning it into something timeless.   Vinicius supports all sports, including boring ones like golf. Vincinius' bright colors radiate positivity and sunshine, much like the aesthetics of the city he represents. He's not one animal, however. Instead he is a Frankenstein-esque combination of different Brazilian creatures. This is also supposed to be a reflection on the cultural melting pot that is Brazil, which adds a nice deeper meaning. But he's also just very cute.  He's also a huge hit with the ladies. This year's mascot is adorable and also very appropriate for the region's weather. Soohoorang has a delightfully blocky design, but it doesn't compromise his cuddly appeal. And honestly — I love his little eyebrows. He's not the first mascot with eyebrows, of course, but there's something about his strong brow that really ups the cuteness to winning levels.  A good doggo Waldi exudes elegance and poise. He says Germany, without overstating it. He is svelte and refined, proud of his heritage, but not in your face. The color palette is soft and pleasing to the eye, yet he still gets your attention. Silver medal dog, for sure.  Name a more iconic duo It's a sasquatch and a sea bear — and they pay homage to the local legends and culture. That combination alone is worthy of the gold, but throw in their huggable design and you get an Olympic mascot duo that's unique, but not weird; cute, but not predictable; and just absolutely perfect. If you want to dive even deeper into mascot history, a full list of them can be found on the Olympic website. Correction: An early version of this post misstated the year of the Vancouver Olympics. It was 2010, not 2012.  "
8,"If you're not an Amazon Prime member, shopping at the online retailer just got a little more expensive. Amazon offers free shipping on many of its products if customers spend more than a certain amount, but the company has quietly raised that minimum purchase requirement from $35 to $49. For book lovers, however, there is a loophole: If your order contains $25 worth of eligible books, your shipping will be free. (Eligible books are those fulfilled and shipped by Amazon.) The free shipping on other products only applies to those sold by Amazon and select third-party sellers. The price increase likely stems from Amazon's recent efforts to pull in more Prime subscribers, who pay $99 a year for instant video and free two-day shipping on many products. Although Amazon has kept information about how many people use the service hush hush, Re/Code estimates that it has at least 46 million subscribers.  The increase was evident on Amazon's site on Monday.  The prices for Amazon services have crept up in recent years, including for its Prime customers. The Prime membership was once available to customers for $79, but that changed in 2014 when the company raised rates to $99 a year and released its music streaming service not long after. Unlike many subscription-based services, Amazon requires members to pay the cost of the full year up front rather than on a monthly basis, although the site advertises special discounts.  The latest price jump may be designed to offset the cost of Prime users taking advantage of free shipping — the fact that Amazon loses money because of the cost associated with Prime shipping is well documented. Back in January, the company's stock dipped after Amazon spent $4.55 billion to fulfill customers’ orders, up from $3.4 billion in the same quarter a year ago, MarketWatch reported.  If the company can push users to spend more or subscribe, it'll be a win-win for the retailing behemoth. Non-Prime members, however, won't be so fortunate."

12,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Roger Federer celebrated his 100th match at the Australian Open on Friday by giving young American Taylor Fritz a center court schooling to reach the last 16 and set up a mouthwatering clash with ‘Next Gen’ champion Stefanos Tsitsipas. Chasing a record seventh Melbourne title and his third in succession, the 37-year-old Swiss has been in ominous form at the year’s first Grand Slam and his 6-2 7-5 6-2 masterclass at Rod Laver Arena was another warning to the Tour’s upstarts. Fritz, 21, was meant to offer Federer a meaningful test with his prodigious serve and powerful ground-strokes but was instead sent packing after less than 90 minutes. Third seed Federer tied the American in knots with a sumptuous array of drop shots, angled volleys and winners conjured seemingly at will from behind the baseline. Fans hoping for change at the top of men’s tennis will look to Greek trailblazer Tsitsipas to give Federer a better shake. The shaggy-haired 20-year-old, who capped a breakout season by claiming the Next Gen ATP Finals in Milan in December, has ridden a wave of support from Melbourne’s huge Greek community at the tournament. Federer has his own army of fans at Melbourne Park, however, and they hung on his every word as he delivered words of encouragement to the young pretenders seeking to knock him off the perch. “They’re doing great, what do you want me to tell you?” he told Jim Courier in his on-court interview. “We all want them to win the big stuff but it just takes time ... I’m still giving them a hard time sometimes.” Federer has reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for a record-extending 63rd time in the professional era and may still be the best equipped player to deny top seed Novak Djokovic from claiming a third Grand Slam title in succession. Citing Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey, who won an Olympic silver at 40 and continued to run into her fifties, a reporter asked Federer whether his best might still be to come. “No, I don’t think so,” he said bluntly. “I think the last 10 years have been a lot of fun, maybe more fun than the first 10, I’m not sure. “But yeah, I don’t think with four children and with the career that I have had and my body, I want it to be somewhat healthy — and healthy actually when I retire. “I don’t think that’s a good idea, you know, to be quite honest.” Editing by Peter Rutherford"

The interests range from management deals with golf courses in the UAE, branding agreements with real estate projects that bear Trump's name in India as well as companies that have been involved with beverage sales in Israel. Democrats try to force a fight on Trump's business interests Some of Trump's dealings have already become a focal point of controversy, such as Trump Towers Istanbul, which received criticism from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after Trump proposed a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Despite the revelations from the lengthy disclosures Trump filed during his presidential campaign, the full extent of his international business ties remain unknown since Trump has refused to release his tax returns.

14,"Didi Mobility Japan, a joint venture (JV) by China's Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Corp, said it would expand its taxi-hailing service to 13 cities across Japan. The app was first rolled out in September in Osaka, a popular destination for Chinese tourists, where it has tied up with 40 taxi firms in an increasingly crowded market for such apps that includes rivals backed by Sony and Toyota Motor. It is expanding into Tokyo and Kyoto from Wednesday, with a further 10 locations to follow in the current financial year. Despite SoftBank's oversized presence in the global ride-hailing industry, such services are effectively banned in Japan, leaving SoftBank portfolio companies like Didi and Uber limited to offering services that match taxis with customers. Didi is among a growing number of SoftBank Group Corp-backed companies launching JVs with SoftBank's domestic telco. Other startups doing so are shared co-working firm WeWork Cos and Indian hotel startup OYO. As part of SoftBank's efforts to drive synergies between its portfolio companies users will be able to access the taxi-hailing service through Yahoo Japan's route-finding app and pay via PayPay, an app that uses tech from India's Paytm."
15,"The S&P 500 just posted a historic winning streak, but some market participants are predicting that the long-running bull market could be on its last legs. According to Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, the S&P 500 has now gone 242 trading sessions without a 3 percent pullback — its longest streak ever and topping the previous record of 241 days set in 1995. Since the most recent streak began, the S&P has posted more than 20 percent returns over that period of time. While the markets could continue to churn higher, Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com warned it could be entering its final few innings. ""We are in the third and final phase [of the classic Dow Theory], which is suggesting through the use of parallel channel that there is room towards 3,000 depending on the angle of ascent,"" he explained. The Dow Theory refers to three primary phases — accumulation, participation and distribution — which underpin a major market trend. ""I think we're in the distribution phase. That being said, I do see room up towards the top end of this channel, once we start to paint that in up around 3,000,"" he said Monday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" That's roughly 17 percent higher than where the S&P 500 is trading right now. However, Gordon added that the lack of volatility has him worried that a pullback is on the way. ""This is the quietest, in terms of a range, stock market on a monthly basis back to as far as 1905,"" he said. ""We're [trading] at about 4.5 percent monthly high to low range, that's the quietest in history."" For Chantico Global CEO Gina Sanchez, the market's complacency has been fed by a drop in key correlations and it could signal trouble ahead for equities. ""You're just diversifying away all risk, meaning the underlying stocks are much riskier than the aggregate looks like,"" she explained. ""[The S&P's] very narrow range [is] being diversified away by these low correlations, and it's lulling people into a severe sense of complacency."" She added that the last time correlations were this low, they preceded the 2001 dot-com bubble that sent the market tumbling. The S&P set another intra-day record on Monday before closing lower."
16,"(New throughout, updates prices and market activity) * U.S.’ Ross says preliminary trade deal may be signed this month * MSCI world equity index up 0.57% to highest since January 2018 * Oil prices creep higher on trade hopes and OPEC talks By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The dollar strengthened and global stock markets rallied on Monday on signs the United States and China are nearing the end of a damaging trade war as well as indications the world economy may yet dodge a recession. The three major U.S. stock indexes set record intraday highs and MSCI’s gauge of equity performance across the globe rose to less than 2% from an all-time peak set in January 2018. Beijing and Washington spoke Friday of progress in trade talks and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Sunday licenses for U.S. companies to sell components to China’s blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co will come shortly. Washington has effectively banned federal agencies from buying Huawei telecommunications equipment and barred U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei, citing national security. Gold edged lower while the dollar gained on higher risk appetite as trade hopes grew after Ross said there was no reason a deal could not be on track for signing this month. A generally upbeat U.S. employment report on Friday added to optimism that the slowing U.S. economy was not headed toward recession. “Market trends are being influenced by a better risk mood overall,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. European shares rallied more than 1%, with many reaching their highest level since January 2018. The STOXX 600 index of small, mid-sized and large companies across Europe surged to highs last seen in July 2015. Tariff-exposed European miners gained 2.9% while auto stocks also rose 2.9%. Reports that Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA aimed to sign a final merger agreement as early as next month also lifted stocks. Earlier, trade hopes sent Asian stocks surging, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 1.3%. Technology stocks boosted Wall Street, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index hitting a new high, up 2.02%. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.48% while its emerging markets rose 1.34%. “Signing these deals takes time. All that is needed for markets to be happy right now is for an agreement to be announced,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 96.51 points, or 0.35%, to 27,443.87. The S&P 500 gained 12.15 points, or 0.40%, to 3,079.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 53.33 points, or 0.64%, to 8,439.73. The euro slipped as investors awaited Christine Lagarde’s first speech as European Central Bank president. But the single currency remained near its highest levels in weeks after Ross said in the interview that Washington may not slap tariffs on imported vehicles after “good conversations” with automakers in the European Union, Japan and Korea. The dollar index rose 0.33%, with the euro down 0.19% to $1.1144. The Japanese yen weakened 0.43% versus the greenback at 108.62 per dollar. Euro zone and U.S. bond yields rose on optimism a U.S.-China trade deal appeared near. Data on Monday showed morale among investors in the euro zone jumped in November to its highest since June. Germany’s benchmark 10-year Bund yield was at -0.35% while the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 17/32 in price to push its yield up to 1.7875%. Oil prices rose, buoyed by an improved outlook for crude demand as better-than-expected U.S. jobs growth fed hopes. Brent crude futures for January rose 44 cents to settle at $62.13 a barrel. U.S. crude futures settled up 34 cents at $56.54 a barrel. Spot gold dropped 0.4% to $1,507.25 an ounce. Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Gertrude

18,"BOGOTA, June 6 (Reuters) - Colombia coffee shop chain Juan Valdez will focus on expanding its presence in Latin America, including returning to Mexico and debuting in Argentina, before it looks further afield to Asia and Europe, the chain’s president said.  Juan Valdez stores were founded in 2002 by the growers’ federation in the world’s top producer of washed arabica to sell premium Colombian coffee.  The chain has some 300 stores in Colombia and 131 in 13 other countries, including Ecuador, Chile, the United States, Spain and Panama.  “We’re putting things in order internationally, strengthening the markets where we already are with an important focus on Latin America,” Camila Escobar, the president of Procafecol, which owns Juan Valdez, said in an interview on Wednesday.  “In coming years we’ll continue conquering the world in places like Asia and Europe, which have a very relevant participation in coffee.”  The chain will return to Mexico this year, Escobar said, after closing its eight stores in the country in 2018. Its previous partnership model was unprofitable but the company is close to signing a deal with a new partner, she said.  Escobar would not say how many stores the chain plans to open in Mexico.  Juan Valdez stores will also make a 2019 debut in Argentina, she said, but entrance to Asia and European countries besides Spain could take about five years depending on finances.  The chain has about 30% of the coffee shop market in Colombia, where it competes with local chains Tostao and Oma and international heavyweight Starbucks Corp.  The chain has 100 own-brand coffee machines in offices around Colombia and hopes to expand that product to Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Panama in the coming months.  “We want to be there for the customer wherever the customer is,” said Escobar, 37.  The chain buys coffee directly from Colombian farmers and contributes to a fund to help growers weathering low international prices.  Colombia has lost 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) of coffee planting area over the last 18 months as desperate farmers leave the industry because of prices, the growers’ federation has said.  Juan Valdez sells some 30,000 coffee drinks per day and employs 1,500 people in Colombia. (Reporting by Luis Jaime Acosta Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb Editing by Helen Murphy and Susan Thomas)"
19,"Larkin leads Red Wings to win over Coyotes DETROIT — Dylan Larkin shoulders much of the blame for last season, which saw the Detroit Red Wings’ 25-season run of playoff appearances end. Following a sensational rookie campaign during which the Red Wings center scored a team-leading 23 goals and played in the NHL All-Star Game, Larkin endured a sophomore slump last season, dropping to 17 goals and finishing with a minus-28 rating. “I really felt like last year it was partially on me, or a lot of it was on me,” Larkin said after he contributed a goal and an assist to Detroit’s 5-3 victory over the Arizona Coyotes on Tuesday. With his two-point night, Larkin (2-10-12) moved into the club’s scoring lead. Larkin assisted on linemate Anthony Mantha’s club-best fifth goal of the season. Gustav Nyquist, Luke Glendening and Darren Helm also scored for the Red Wings (6-6-1), who won for the second straight game. Jason Demers, Nick Cousins and Clayton Keller replied for the Coyotes (1-11-1), who were unable to win a second consecutive game. Facing a Coyotes team that won a 4-3 overtime decision at Philadelphia the night before, the Red Wings set out to start fast, and they accomplished their mission. Detroit wasted no time in establishing superiority. Nyquist picked off a clearing attempt by Coyotes defenseman Alex Goligoski, skated into the high slot and drilled the puck through traffic past screened Arizona goalie Scott Wedgewood (35 saves) just 1:29 after the opening faceoff. The Red Wings made it 2-0 at 2:37 when Glendening’s wrist shot from the right faceoff dot sailed over the blocker of the sprawling Wedgewood. “I thought we could have had more,” Larkin said. “We stayed patient, though, which I really like. As the game went on, there was no panic, nothing that got to us, except a little sloppy play in the third. “We were trying to cheat too much, or we wanted too much offense, I guess, and we got away from doing it the right way like we were in the first two periods, and that’s how we got our offense.” The Coyotes played with more urgency in the second period and were rewarded for it at 11:36 when Keller dropped the puck to Demers at the point and the defenseman blasted a shot past Detroit goalie Jimmy Howard (30 saves). The rally didn’t last long. Mantha chipped Andreas Athanasiou’s pass into the roof of the net behind Wedgewood to make it 3-1 at 13:03. Before the period was over, Larkin’s cross-crease pass intended for Mantha deflected off the stick of Coyotes defenseman Luke Schenn and past Wedgewood at 19:03. It was Larkin’s first goal since Detroit’s Oct. 5 season opener against the Minnesota Wild. “This is a good lesson for us, because we learned that you can’t play like that on the second half of a back-to-back,” Coyotes center Derek Stepan said. “If you execute your system and you play smart hockey in the first period, the game will come to you in the second and third periods. “We did an extremely poor job of that.” Catching the Red Wings on a bad line change, the Coyotes scored at the two-minute mark of the third period when Cousins swatted a backhand shot past Howard from a goalmouth scramble. The visitors drew within a goal of the lead when Keller’s shot bounced past Howard at 16:43 of the third. “To be honest with you, I guess it went off the knob of my stick,” Howard said. “I don’t think it touched anyone on the way in.” Helm tallied into the empty net at 18:38 to complete the scoring. NOTES: Coyotes C Clayton Keller (9-6-15) and Vancouver Canucks RW Brock Boeser (2-7-9) are the only rookies leading their teams in scoring. ... The Coyotes own an NHL-worst minus-23 goal differential. ... The Coyotes are the NHL’s worst penalty-killing team at 66.7 percent (20-for-30). ... Red Wings D Danny DeKeyser (sprained ankle) missed his 10th consecutive game. ... D/RW Luke Witkowski and LW David Booth were healthy scratches for the Red Wings. ... The Coyotes’ healthy scratches were LW Anthony Duclair and D Joel Hanley. ... D Niklas Hjalmarsson (upper body) was out, while G Antti Raanta (lower body) and D Jakob Chychrun (lower body) are on injured reserve for Arizona. ... The next point for Coyotes C Max Domi will be his 100th in the NHL. ... The Red Wings completed a season sweep of the Coyotes, also winning 4-2 on Oct. 12 at Arizona."

21,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - American Mikaela Shiffrin had to overcome more than just the best ski racers in the world to win the Olympic giant slalom gold medal on Thursday. She also had to beat herself. Heading into her second run trailing Italy’s Manuela Moelgg, the 22-year-old began hearing the voice of self-doubt that has visited her during the last two seasons, creating anxiety bad enough for her to seek professional help. In the starting gate she silenced the voice, let go of the doubt and crushed the run, beating silver medalist Ragnhild Mowinckel of Norway by a healthy 0.39 seconds. “There were moments where I thought, I don’t know if I’m good enough to do this,” Shiffrin told reporters. “And then there were moments where I thought, who cares? You gotta try. You’re here,” she said with a smile. The key for Shiffrin, whose celebrity has grown steadily since she won the slalom gold in Sochi in 2014 at the age of 18, has been to reconnect with the joy of skiing, which she did in front of a supportive crowd at the Yongpyong Alpine Center. “Today I was trying really hard but I also was feeling the hill, I was feeling the mountain and I was feeling my skis,” she said. “I was really letting it go as much as I could in that second run,” she said. “It’s an incredible feeling to know that my best effort is good enough.” Her best could be enough to win multiple medals in South Korea as she makes her case to be called America’s all-time best Olympic Alpine skier. While Shiffrin may experience bouts of self-doubt, her competitors see only a composed and focused assassin on the course. “She’s the toughest mentally,” said Federica Brignone of Italy, who won bronze in Thursday’s race. “She can do what she does in training on the course. For sure I think she was stressed too today because I’ve seen her skiing better in training but so was I and so were all the girls. “But she’s so in there, she can do it better than us. I think we are more emotional than her.” Reporting by Rory Carroll; Additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan, editing by Ed Osmond"
22,"primary vote@ (Updates prices) Aug 9 (Reuters) - Most Latin American currencies were set to end a tumultuous week on a soft note on Friday as worries about the U.S.-China trade dispute and global growth kept investors on edge. The Brazilian real fell about 0.5%, giving back some of Thursday's gains of more than 1% when upbeat trade data from China and a stabilizing yuan lifted risk appetite. The mood was glum again on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he was not ready to make a trade deal with China and had decided that the United States would not do business with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies for the time being. ""At this point in time, it's hard to see either the U.S. or China having enough will to resolve their differences, much less before the new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods kick in on September 1,"" said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM. ""Should the barriers to global trade be raised next month, that would be another kick in the gut for risk appetite and may prompt another sell-off in risk assets."" MSCI's index of emerging market stocks as well as currencies were set to post a third straight week of losses. Argentina's main stock index shot up 7% as investors adjusted investment portfolios ahead of the country's primary election on Sunday, which will determine President Mauricio Macri's chances of winning a second term in October. The country's embattled peso, which has shed over 8% in the past month, is expected to take another beating next week if the business-friendly Macri fares worse than expected. Sao Paulo-listed shares erased early gains as miner Vale fell 3.2 % due to a plunge in iron ore prices. However, a 5.8% jump in shares of food processor BRF SA on swinging back to quarterly profit, and a near 33% surge in healthcare insurer Qualicorp SA after private hospital group Rede D'Or Sao Luiz agreed to buy a 10% stake in the company, boosted the main index. After Brazil's pension reform bill was passed in the lower house of Congress on Wednesday, investors are awaiting a vote in the Senate, which is expected to consider extending the reform to states and municipal governments. ""We expect the pension reform discussion to conclude before October this year, and we don't expect much watering down in the proposal either,"" said Wilson Ferrarezi, an economist at TS Lombard. From a markets points of view the reform has cleared its major hurdle when it was approved by the Lower House, he said. But volatility might still remain high as the focus will likely shift to other reforms such as the passage of the tax reform, which he expects to be long drawn out. The Mexican peso and stocks held largely steady after data showed industrial output rose 1.1% in June, rebounding from a contraction in the previous month.

Spot gold was unchanged at $1,491.52 an ounce at 10:35 a.m. EDT (1435 GMT), but held a relatively tight range for most of the session. U.S. gold futures were down 0.2% to $1,495.30.

27,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The U.S. trials proved a trial indeed for Missy Franklin but swimming’s golden girl of London 2012 believes she can be back to her best at the Rio Olympics. Franklin set records on her way to four golds and a bronze medal at her first Games, but the 21-year-old qualified in just two individual events — the 200 meters freestyle and 200 backstroke — at the trials in Omaha. That did not include the 100 meter backstroke, one of her Olympic titles. Despite that, she is still smiling. “I’ve felt for the past several months that I am in the best shape I have ever been in,” Franklin told a news conference on Wednesday. “I think trials was just a very different experience for me and I think I wasn’t really prepared for the emotional aspect of it...coming in this year I think I felt the pressure a lot more than I ever have before. “I’ve normally been able to handle that really well and that was something that I really struggled with at trials,” she added. With that ordeal over, and many swimmers have commented over the years how the process is every bit as pressured as an Olympic final, Franklin said she had a fresh surge of confidence. “I still have that power, I still have those guts that I really believe I’ve had my whole career,” she said. “With a lot of that pressure gone, and with a better mental mindset coming in here ... I won’t only have all that endurance that I built up but also the heart and guts to go on top of that. I think that’s a pretty killer combination.” Katie Ledecky won the 200 freestyle at the trials and looks set to be the talk of the women’s team this time around with a possible individual golden triple as well as relays. Franklin was gushing in her praise for the 19-year-old, who won 800m freestyle gold in London and has since made herself unbeatable over the distance. “It’s been such an honor to watch her,” she said. “I think she’s capable of unbelievable things, doing things that no-one in this world has ever seen before. “To be able to tell my kids one day or tell stories that ‘hey, I was there when Katie Ledecky did this’. That is so cool for me ... hopefully I can push her the way she’s pushed me similar to how we talk about Australia pushing the U.S.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

31,"Adriene Mishler exudes plenty of mushy-gushy spiritual thinking, but the yoga evangelist embraces something else, too: self-deprecating humor. That's part of what has made her so accessible to her 3.2 million YouTube subscribers. When she mentions self-love or chakras, she bookends it with “Okayyyy, Adriene,” or when she directs you to sit in a cross-armed-cross-legged pretzel of a pose as you lift your head, she mumbles, “This is like Ariel on the rock, speaking to my generation, a little mermaid joke.”  It’s why her fans call her goofy and authentic, an overused cliche in the YouTube world, but they really mean it. They insist! There’s just something about Adriene.  If you’re already rolling your eyes, take a deep, cleansing breath. It's worth trying to wrap your head around why this particular woman has the top six videos when you search “yoga” on YouTube and dominates Google search.  Adriene has been hosting free yoga videos on Yoga with Adriene since 2012. At the moment, Adriene is taking mental notes about Peru. When the 33-year-old tells me she rearranged her schedule to take adult Spanish classes so she can teach yoga when she visits Spanish-speaking countries, I mention one of her fans in Peru already translates her videos into Spanish. A Peace Corps volunteer there leads about 25 students, ages 5 to 84, in an hour-long flow, Monday through Friday. “Wow, I just got the chills,” Adriene says. You see, one of Adriene’s other fans from the Netherlands, who followed her yoga classes on a European tour like a Deadhead, recently quit her job as a vice principal and moved to Peru, where she founded a nonprofit teaching yoga to underserved children, with Yoga with Adriene's motto, “Find What Feels Good,” at the core. It’s called Con Pazion, and Adriene's sponsor, Adidas, donated $10,000 to the budding organization on her behalf. Yoga with Adriene fans have also donated, with some now sitting on Con Pazion's board. “It’s all starting to fall into place somehow,” Adriene says.   Leonie van Iersel, the Yoga with Adriene fan who founded Con Pazion (center), and her students. Although her mother is Mexican-American, Adriene never learned Spanish as a child. She jokes that she probably knows more Sanskrit, the ancient Indian language used in yoga practice, than Spanish. When she was in high school, she took American Sign Language instead because she had deaf friends.  While she's excited to learn, it means she has to give up something she's done for a decade, even after her meteoric YouTube rise: teach yoga, IRL, on Saturday mornings.  For yoga instructors, a Saturday morning studio slot means you've made it. And moving on fills her with bittersweet nostalgia.  “I used to joke that the only people who would come to my classes are my friends and my mom, and of course I would never let any of them pay."" ""Yoga with Adriene"" was the most googled workout in 2015. She won a 2016 Streamy Award in the Health and Wellness category, and in January of this year Google searches for “Yoga with Adriene” reached an all-time high — spiking by 40 percent since November 2017.  But she didn't start out intending to be an internet sensation. When she was 19, she’d sub, teach kids’ classes, and lug around a jam box and burnt CDs all over her hometown of Austin — anything to teach yoga. “I used to joke that the only people who would come to my classes are my friends and my mom, and of course I would never let any of them pay, and then I’d end up paying rent at the studio where I was teaching and not making any money,” she said.  She wouldn’t disclose her YouTube revenue, but according to analytics firm SocialBlade, Yoga with Adriene pulls in anywhere from $3,000 to $45,000 a month. (It's a big range, but YouTube estimates are often like that due to complicated ad schemes.) That doesn’t include intake from her subscription video service, Adidas sponsorship, events, or merchandise. She’s currently writing a book about her relationship with yoga and planning her own yoga teacher training program.  Yoga with Adriene encourages viewers to ""find what feels good."" Back when Adriene was losing money on her yoga classes, she taught children drama and acted on the side. It was on an indie movie set where she met Chris Sharpe, the film’s director, who’d later become her business partner and the Greg to her Dharma.  The movie was about a girl band in a post-apocalyptic world. At first Adriene passed on it — she had auditioned for Juilliard, she had trained in New York, she wanted to do theater — but was convinced when she heard her friend was part of the cast. That friend later married Sharpe and now has her own YouTube cooking channel.  “It never got finished and I do thank god for that because we had quite the get-ups,” Adriene says, giggling. After the movie fell apart, Chris emailed Adriene in 2010, pitching a yoga YouTube channel. But the idea just sat there, gestating for two years until the duo made Yoga with Adriene’s first video. The actor in Adriene wanted to nail every moment, but Chris encouraged her to relax and act like Mr. Rogers inviting people into her home. After that, it clicked.  All Adriene wanted to do was provide free at-home yoga for the masses when most classes cost between $15 and $20. It took her awhile to warm up to the social media circus and SEO-focused video titles. Her library of under 30-minute videos is diverse, to say the least: There’s yoga for mornings, bedtime, teachers, depression, golfers, disasters, a broken heart. You name it, she’s probably got it. And her blue heeler, Benji, is often seen lounging around, sometimes snuggling up on the mat as she maneuvers around him.  “I was nervous to take yoga out of its sacred space and slapdash it into this digital space,” says Adriene. “That’s why it took forever for me to title any video ‘Yoga for weight loss’ or ‘Yoga for flow.’” But it’s titles like those that likely pushed her to the top of Google and YouTube search.   “It’s very savvy how she structured it,” said Allon Caidar, a YouTube metadata expert and founder and CEO of TVPage, a video commerce platform. Adriene focuses on keywords and has more than one video about highly-searched topics, he points out. Despite multiple high-profile YouTuber scandals (ahem Pewdiepie, ahem Logan Paul), Caidar predicts that marketing budgets focused on influencers like Adriene, especially in the lifestyle and health sectors, will grow this year.  Adriene jokes that one April Fools’ Day she wants to upload the same video with two titles: one focused on self-love and another on weight loss to test which gets more views.  “Just to kind of prove a point,” she says. “With the titles, I’m using the platform to bring more people to the mat.” Yaiza Varona, a 39-year-old in the UK, found Adriene because of her high ranking. She was browsing for a yoga video on YouTube, clicked the first one, and now she's a Yoga with Adriene disciple.  I couldn’t agree more! She got my 2 sisters and I doing yoga on a regular basis for 3+ years now, then I ‘infected’ another 2 friends...hers is the kind of work that improves your life so much you need to share with the world. — Yaiza Varona (@yaizavarona) January 25, 2018 “If she said paint yourself blue, I’d do it. At this moment, I trust whatever she says because it feels so right,” the music composer says. “I’m not that much into yoga as a philosophy, but she brings it down to Earth. She focuses so much on enjoying being in your body.” Megan-Eileen Waldrep, the Peace Corps volunteer in Peru, says it may sound silly, but to her, Adriene feels like a friend.  “She makes jokes or weird references and then says under her breath, ‘I don’t know why I said that,’ which is hilarious. It’s an unedited flow of her stream of consciousness and yoga,” the 25-year-old from Chicago says. leading a morning class of @yogawithadriene flows gets me started every morning as a @PeaceCorps volunteer pic.twitter.com/Ea1s9Runoh — Megan-Eileen Waldrep (@Megan_Eileen_) January 26, 2018 There are critics who deride Adriene for being “that YouTube yogi,” though.  “They’re judging a book by its cover, and they don’t understand that I’ve poured my whole little heart and soul into trying to be mindful of how I share this information,” she says.  Adriene is used to pouring her heart and soul into things. She’s been doing it since she was a kid. Over Christmas, she was laughing with her dad about how she spent hours as a child recording her own theater and dance shows on VHS. Decades later, she’s still filming her own productions, only now she has a core staff of four. Adriene's been in some indie movies, she plays a journalist in Rooster Teeth's Day 5, and has voiced characters like Lois Lane and Supergirl for DC Universe Online. She'll keep acting even as she expands her yoga business, she says. It's a dream she can't shake. Texas friends! Join me for our next community yoga gathering at @fairmarketatx! Tuesday Feb 27th!

And if you watch those videos, you’ll be in on the joke when the floor creaks beneath your feet, just like Adriene’s does at home. “I would love for us to look back and go, ‘Remember when yoga was this thing you went to at the gym, and now it’s like brushing your teeth, washing your vegetables, taking a shower, something that you do in your home regularly,'"" she says. ""We’re not far from that. I’d like to look back and know that I did my part to trailblaze that offering.” "
32,"It's easy to assume that just because something is scientific it's true.  That doesn't account for the glut of conflicting findings both in academia and industry over the past century and how social constructs have impacted scientific judgement. It also doesn't account for the fact that science has been — and in some cases continues to be — dominated by men and their often collective worldview.  Just think about how that male dominance has impacted the way the scientific community has represented women — both in terms of female participation in and contribution to science.  A new book is turning all that history on its head. Inferior by British science writer Angela Saini delves into the many ways that ""science has got women wrong"" using ""new research that is rewriting the story."" The new book attempts to provide an alternative view of science where women are included, rather than excluded.  ""From intelligence to emotion, for centuries science has told us that men and women are fundamentally different. But this is not the whole story,"" writes Saini. Inferior ""sheds light on controversial research and investigates the ferocious gender wars in biology, psychology and anthropology.""   The U.S. cover for the book The book is indeed a reminder of the ways in which science has been used to reinforce or break down sexist stereotypes. We dismantle nine of them below: Despite being the man behind the theory of evolution, Charles Darwin had some pretty un-evolved views about women.  In the book, Saini tracks down a series of letters to and from Darwin shortly before his death in 1881. An American women's rights activist named Caroline Kennard wrote to Darwin asking him to set the record straight about his most important works — On the Origin of the Species (1959) and The Descent of Man (1871) — which at the time were being used to support the argument that women were inferior to men ""based upon scientific principles."" ""In the letter Kennard naturally assumes that a genius like Darwin couldn't possibly believe that women are naturally inferior to men. Surely his work had been misinterpreted?"" writes Saini.  Darwin wrote back, and wow, did he deliver: ""I certainly think that women though generally superior to men [in] moral qualities are inferior intellectually,"" he told her.   Original letters from Charles Darwin on display in 2009. ""Darwin's scientific ideas mirrored society's beliefs at the time and they colored his judgement of what women were capable of doing. His attitude belonged to a train of scientific thinking that stretched back at least as far as the Enlightenment,"" writes Saini. Sure, Darwin's was a product of his time. But is that an excuse? As the book outlines, there were plenty of forward-thinking individuals back in the day — like Albert Wolfe, Caroline Kennard, and Eliza Burt Gamble. It's a massive — but often used — generalization that men have contributed more to science than women have in the past century.  The truth is men have dominated the scientific narrative of the past 100+ years and this is largely because women have not had the same access to the field.  Keep in mind, it wasn't until 1893 that women first got the right to vote in New Zealand and that right didn't extend to the UK and U.S. until 1918 and 1920, respectively. Women were still fighting for their fundamental rights. ""Taking on this male scientific establishment wasn't easy. For nineteenth century women everything was at stake,"" writes Saini.  ""It took until well into the 20th century for women to be granted full degrees in many of the world's universities. Where I studied engineering, in Oxford, they didn't allow women to become full members until 1920, but many others were even slower than that,"" says Saini. ""Europe's scientific academies were even worse. Marie Curie won two Nobel Prizes, and was still rejected by the French Academy of Sciences in 1911. So we have to remember that women are only just catching up from a long legacy of deliberate exclusion. It's only been a few generations since they've even had access to the same educational opportunities as men."" The Victorian suffragist movement urged women to educate themselves to stand a chance of taking on the sexist debate about inferiority.  One of the trailblazers of the time was the scientific suffragist Eliza Burt Gamble. Her book The Evolution of Woman (1894 and revised in 1916) lays out Darwin's inconsistencies and double standards with regard to gender.  Gamble says that inequity in women's contributions to intellectual work were more a result of inequality than innate inferiority. Women weren't allowed to develop their scientific talents, and making assumptions about their abilities based on how they happened to be treated by society was narrow-minded and dangerous.  Eliza Burt Gamble: writer, freethinker, feminist. #GetPissedGetActive #shepersisted #letlizspeak pic.twitter.com/6eOPQ1xtKj — JaySandlinWriter (@JSandlinWriter) February 8, 2017 So there was a counter argument to Darwin's proclamations about gender at the time, but they weren't given equal recognition because they came from a woman.  Gamble's ""army of readers and the support of fellow activists couldn't win biologists around to her point of view,"" writes Saini. ""Her arguments were doomed never to fully enter the scientific mainstream, only to circulate outside it."" In the face of adversity, women have been resourceful and strategic. ""In the past, if women wanted to practice science, they sometimes became assistants to their scientist husbands or fathers, their contributions subsumed under their names,"" says Saini. ""These lost women of science are slowly being rediscovered, but it is tragic that their hard work and talent wasn't recognised at the time.""  A 2002 study carried out on babies unveiled a controversial ""empathizing-systemizing theory.""  It basically said that the female brain is hardwired for empathy while the male brain is built for analyzing and building systems like cars and computers.  This apparently explains the fundamental differences in the hobbies that men and women chose, according to psychologist and neuroscientist Simon Baron-Cohen. For example, men like to repair motorbikes and women prefer to attend coffee mornings in their spare time.  This may come as a shock, but this study has been debunked time and time again. Most notably, a team of psychologists poured cold water on it in 2007, picking out a huge number of problems with the hypothesis.  Scientific study after scientific study has found that there is a 5 ounce difference between male and female brains.  This difference in weight has been used by neuroscientists to reinforce the argument that male and female brains are fundamentally different. It has also been used to imply a difference in intelligence. This was challenged in the late 1800s by the American teacher and writer Helen Hamilton Gardener, the pen name for Alice Chenoweth Day. Working alongside Edward Spitzka (who became president of the American Neurological Association), Gardener observed that the weight of a person's brain couldn't be a measure of intelligence. It was the ratio of body weight, or body size to brain size, that was important.  But as Saini writes: ""The fight over those missing five ounces was a bitter one and it was never resolved in Helen Hamilton Gardener's lifetime.""   Angela Saini says scientists must accept that they're not always objective and they're not always fair. That hasn't stopped the argument from rearing its head over and over again.  In fact, only a few weeks ago a controversial study by scientists at Erasmus University in Rotterdam found that men have higher IQs than women because they have bigger brains. After using the latest scanning technology to measure the brain volumes of 896 people, Professor Dimitri van der Linden, who led the study, said: ""We found that the average IQ of men was about four points above that of women. So if men had an average score of 100, women would score 96.” The study has reignited the controversial debate. But Saini has been quick to stand her ground, telling The Sunday Times: ""It is scientifically well established that there is no difference on average in general intelligence between women and men. It's also well known that women have, on average, slightly smaller brains than men because they are, on average, slightly smaller in size. This paper does not disprove these facts.""  On average men are 6 inches taller and have twice the upper body strength of women. But to classify women as the weaker sex, doesn't tell the whole story. Women are actually stronger at birth and they live for longer.  ""Pretty much at every age, women seem to survive better than men,"" aging expert Steven Austad tells Saini in the book.   Research shows that, from birth, girls are statistically more robust than boys. Joy Lawn, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that boys are around 10 percent at greater risk of dying than girls in the first month of their lives.  Because of the complexity of the female body and the fluctuation of sex hormones, it has simply been cheaper and easier for the pharmaceutical industry to try out new medication on men during clinical trials.  It's been estimated that women are 1.5 times more likely to develop an adverse reaction to a drug than men.  ""Let's face it, everyone in the biomedical community has spent their lives studying one sex or the other. And it's usually males,"" Steven Austad, Chair of Biology Department at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said in an interview.  Some medications have even been taken off the market after having an adverse effect on women. In 2000, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that eight out of 10 prescription drugs taken off the market since 1997 posed greater health risks to women than men.  This is pretty egregious but thankfully things are improving. ""There has been a huge movement in the United States to include women in clinical trials for new drugs and the imbalance is being gradually corrected,"" says Saini. ""The hope is that in the future, we won't see the kind of mistakes that we've seen in the past because females will be better represented, not just in the drug development process, but in research as a whole.""  So much is known about the male body. But vaginas have more or less been ignored.  Even when you think about the solutions provided for period pains — women are often given an overly simplistic solution. Take ibuprofen.  Sexist stereotypes have been been cited as the root cause for why period pains are not afforded the same level of importance by doctors as other ailments, because women are somehow ""exaggerating"" or being ""dramatic.""  “Men don’t get it and it hasn’t been given the centrality it should,” John Guillebaud, professor of reproductive health at University College London, told Quartz. “I do believe it’s something that should be taken care of, like anything else in medicine.” Period pain is officially as bad as a heart attack - so why have doctors ignored it? The answer is simple https://t.co/T8GfNWcmJ3 — Independent Voices (@IndyVoices) May 15, 2017 ""In animal biology across all species there is more research on male sexual organs than there is on female ones ... Medicine research has neglected problems that affect only women,"" adds Saini. Women are naturally more monogamous and more selective about who they chose to shack up with, right? Not necessarily. Social context has a big role to play.  A 1978 study at Florida State University found that women and men were as likely to go on a date with a stranger but none of the women would sleep with one.  In 2015, scientists in Germany carried out a similar study with some interesting changes to the results. Women were found to be just as ""up for it"" as men, but fear of judgement, damage to reputation, or concerns about physical safety played a role in their decision. TL;DR: When society isn't judging, women's sex drive rivals mens.  So cultural and societal norms play a big role in women's behaviour. Saini's book explains how it is as acceptable for women to have affairs as men in many indigenous populations, for example.  There is also plenty of evidence from the animal kingdom to challenge that preconceived notion of coy, chaste, females. Forty years ago the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy found that female Langur monkeys can benefit from mating with more than one male.   ""In evolutionary psychology some male researchers insist that the female menopause evolved because no man of any age would find an older woman attractive,"" Saini says in the above video.  She's referring to evolutionary biologist Rama Singh from the McMaster University of Canada, who along with Richard Morton and Jonathon Stone, made global news headlines in 2013 when a paper (published in PLOS Computational Biology) said older women become infertile because men don't find them attractive. At the time, an article by Stone ran with the headline ""Putting the Men in Menopause.""   We're calling B.S. on this one and we're not alone. The theory that women dry up because they're no longer desirable to men was shut down from scientists of other research disciplines.  ""The reason men don't prefer post-menopausal women is that they're post-menopausal and they can't get pregnant, not the other way round,"" said Rebecca Sear, a scientist at the LSHTM.  Not all ideas are good or decent. Not all science is objective or neutral. Not all ""evidence"" is what is presents itself to be. Thankfully there are authors like Angela Saini challenging what we *think* we know.  Angela Saini is an award-winning British science journalist and broadcaster.

33,"(Reuters) - Humana Inc (HUM.N) reported a 28 percent drop in quarterly profit as it set aside more money to cover losses in its Obamacare business, and the company said it would discontinue next year most of these plans sold off public exchanges. The U.S. health insurer, whose acquisition by rival Aetna Inc AET.N has been challenged by U.S. antitrust authorities, said it planned to shrink its individual commercial business to 156 counties next year from 1,351 currently. Under the business, Humana offers individual insurance plans both on and off the public exchanges set up under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The company said it expected premiums of $750 million-$1 billion in 2017 from its Obamacare plans, way lower than the $3.4 billion estimated for 2016. U.S. health insurers, including Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), have been losing money in their Obamacare businesses due to high medical costs. Humana set aside about $208 million more in the second quarter to cover losses in the business, which it currently operates in 15 U.S. states. The company said it would shrink the business to 11 states next year and had already limited memberships in the four states where it no longer intended to offer the plans. Humana had said in May it would exit the Obamacare business in some states. The company and Aetna announced a deal on Tuesday to sell a portfolio of about 290,000 of their Medicare Advantage members in 21 states to Molina Healthcare Inc (MOH.N) to win U.S. antitrust approval for their merger. Humana’s individual commercial memberships fell by nearly a quarter in the three months ended June 30. Net income fell to $311 million, or $2.06 per share. Excluding items, the company earned $2.30 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.23, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 2 percent to $14.01 billion, topping the average estimate of $13.59 billion. Reporting by Amrutha Penumudi in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey"

Capitec has grown rapidly over the past decade as millions of cost-conscious consumers switched from South Africa’s established banks to Capitec. It has 9.2 million customers, up an average of 106,000 per month over the past year to now account for around 27 percent of the market, CEO Gerrie Fourie said. “If we can take that up to 35 percent, which I think is possible, then you can bring in another 2.5 million clients,” he told Reuters. South Africa has about 16 million youths who are yet to enter formal banking, which Fourie sees as a future source of new clients.

39,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of major currencies and hovered near more than five-month lows on Friday after traders grew less confident that stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data would alter the Federal Reserve’s dovish course. The dollar initially rebounded from recent losses after Labor Department data showed a jump in U.S. non-farm payrolls and average hourly earnings last month and a separate U.S. manufacturing report for March was better than expected. That effect wore thin as the U.S. session continued, with traders growing skeptical that the data was enough to suggest a swifter pace of Fed rate hikes. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday that the central bank should proceed “cautiously” on raising rates. “These reports don’t change the outlook significantly in terms of U.S. monetary policy,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. The euro weakened to $1.1335 following the U.S. jobs and manufacturing data after earlier hitting a 5-1/2-month high of $1.1437. The euro rebounded later in the session, however, and was last up 0.14 percent against the dollar at $1.1394. The dollar also weakened against the yen and hit its lowest level in a week and a half at 111.61 yen JPY=. “This is just giving an ongoing signal of underlying yen strength,” said Alan Ruskin, global head of FX strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York, on the dollar’s weakness against the Japanese currency. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last mostly flat at 94.615 and not far from a 5-1/2-month low of 94.319 struck on Thursday. The failure to gain upward momentum came a day after the index posted its biggest quarterly percentage loss in more than five years, of more than 4 percent. The dollar index was set to post its biggest weekly percentage decline since early February, of 1.6 percent. The euro meanwhile was poised for its biggest weekly gain against the dollar since the same date, of about 2 percent. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was last down 0.27 percent at 0.9585 franc, down from a session high of 0.9627 franc hit after the U.S. data.

41,"This world has never suffered from an overabundance of empathy. Even when we're trying to be kind, we have a bad habit of falling back on judgment and condescension, of projecting our own issues and beliefs onto the decisions of others.  So when something like The Florida Project comes along, it feels all the more remarkable.  In his last film, Tangerine, director Sean Baker chronicled a night in the life of two trans sex workers, just blocks away but a world removed from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.  In The Florida Project, Baker bypasses Orlando's famous Disney resorts for its outskirts, setting up shop in a run-down motel on the outskirts. It's called the Magic Castle, but there's nothing really magical about it. Indeed, it's the kind of place that might drive a couple of middle-class honeymooners to tears when they discover they've accidentally booked a room there instead of the Magic Kingdom.  But to six-year-old Moonee, it's just home. She's a semi-permanent resident there, sharing a room with her 22-year-old single mom, Halley. Halley's love for her daughter is never in doubt, and if that were enough to raise a kid on, Moonee would be the luckiest kid in the world. In a reality where bills must be paid, however, Halley's inability to hold down a steady job puts this little family on a shaky foundation. It'd be fair to say that nothing really ""happens"" for large swaths of The Florida Project, but ""nothing happens"" here in the same way that ""nothing happens"" in real life. (Or in Boyhood, another film that presented life as a series of little and big moments.) There's no obvious narrative arc for most of the movie, just the everyday rhythm of life with Moonee.   The first time we meet her, she's screaming at the top of her lungs to a friend who lives just down the road, before going off to spit on a stranger's parked car. Not out of malice or anything like that, but just because they're kids, and it's summer, and they don't have anything better to do.  Tomorrow will be yet another summer day full of nothing to do, so Moonee and her friends might badger locals for money to buy ice cream, or explore an abandoned home full of mirrors to break and walls to smash. It's a sweet, sticky life, and Baker employs a kid's-level perspective to let you live it with Moonee.  Gradually, though, a darkness starts to creep in around the edges, as Halley's unemployment makes it harder and harder to keep Moonee's world intact. As Moonee, Brooklynn Prince is a revelation. There's not a single artificial note in her performance, just raw charm. Together, Baker and Prince make it achingly clear what Moonee knows, and what Moonee doesn't know, and what Moonee doesn't think she knows but can somehow sense all the same. Equally good is Bria Vinaite as Halley, a generally easygoing soul that life keeps trying to push toward desperation.  Both actresses are first-timers, which might account for how real they feel – but Baker also gets a fantastically naturalistic performance out of Dafoe, the manager of the Magic Castle. He's as tough as he needs to be, but he's not without sympathy for his residents, and even steps up as their protector on occasion. People like him help shield Moonee from some of the harshest realities this world has to offer, even in a place as downtrodden as the Magic Castle.  The Florida Project is a film about people in poverty, but with the emphasis on the ""people."" This isn't misery porn. It resists the temptation to condemn or mock these characters on the one hand, and to idealize them on the other.  The Florida Project just lets them be, in all the beauty and idiosyncracy and fucked-upness that that entails. The world could use more films like it. "
42,"Jackie Chan was among four Hollywood players to receive honorary Oscars at the Governors Awards during a ceremony in Los Angeles this weekend. The annual awards, which were announced in September, honor industry figures for lifetime achievement in movies. “I still can’t believe I’m standing here; it’s a dream,” Mr. Chan, 62, said when he accepted the award on Saturday. “Finally, this is mine,” he added, shaking the statuette. The winners of the Governors Awards, which were founded in 2009, are chosen by a vote by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In some years, they also honor people for their humanitarian works in addition to their work in movies. In recent years, board members have started to lobby aggressively for certain candidates to be recognized, and the awards’ visibility has grown. Four artists were honored this year. The British film editor Anne V. Coates, who edited “Lawrence of Arabia,” and, more recently, “Fifty Shades of Grey”; the casting director Lynn Stalmaster; and the documentarian and director Frederick Wiseman also collected prizes. In his acceptance speech, Mr. Chan said that his father used to ask him when he would win an Oscar, but he told his father it would never happen, because he made action comedies. After starting to leave the stage, Mr. Chan yelled over the music (causing the band to stop playing) to add a thank you to his fans. Because of them, he said, he had reason to continue jumping through windows and breaking his bones."

44,"PODGORICA (Reuters) - The trial of 14 people in Montenegro accused of an election day plot to kill the prime minister and bring a pro-Russian party to power began on Wednesday, with defense lawyers demanding the state prosecutor be removed from the case. Montenegro says a group of Serb and Russian nationalists had a plan to attack state institutions on the day of an election last year and kill then-Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who held the post for a total of 21 years. The Kremlin has dismissed the accusation as absurd. Montenegro’s opposition accuses the government of fabricating the plot in order to keep Djukanovic and his Democratic Party of Socialists in power, which it did by a narrow win. “This is a politically staged process,” said an aide to Andrija Mandic, one of two pro-Russian opposition leaders on trial. The defendants include 2 Russians, 9 Serbians and 3 Montenegrins, of which four are being tried in absentia. Among them are two Russian nationals accused of masterminding the plot. At the first hearing on Wednesday, defense lawyers called for state prosecutor Milivoj Katnic to be dismissed from the case after his office published a transcript of a conversation between a defendant and his lawyer on its website on Monday. “It is clear that after this the prosecutor has to stop working on this case,” said Mandic’s lawyer, Miroje Jovanovic. A spokeswoman at the state prosecutor’s office denied to comment. Montenegro says one of the aims of the coup attempt was to prevent it from joining NATO, which it did in June this year. Montenegro and other countries in the region fear meddling from Moscow to further what they believe is a Russian foreign policy of expansion. No date has been set for the next hearing.

46,"The authorities charged a man on Monday in connection with nearly a dozen shootings in and around a Southern California state park that left a father dead as he camped with his two young daughters and terrorized two affluent communities for almost two years. The suspect, Anthony Rauda, 42, was charged with murder in the June 2018 killing of Tristan Beaudette, 35, a scientist shot while he was inside a tent with his children at Malibu Creek State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains outside Los Angeles. His children were not hurt in the attack. Mr. Rauda, a felon who was on parole at the time of the attacks, was also charged with 10 counts of attempted murder in the shootings beginning in November 2016 in and around the park, which abuts the upscale communities of Calabasas and Malibu. He was arrested in October after sheriff’s deputies saw him on a ridge dressed in black with a rifle sticking out of his backpack, according to The Associated Press. They were searching the area for an armed burglar who stole food from nearby homes and businesses. Mr. Rauda was sentenced in November to 160 days in county jail for violating the terms of his post-release community supervision, said Shiara Davila-Morales, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office. In December, he was sentenced to 180 days in jail for gun and ammunition violations, she said. “There is a huge sense of relief that the suspect has been apprehended and charged with these crimes,” said Alicia Weintraub, the mayor pro tem of Calabasas, which had offered a $5,000 reward for information related to the killing. “It was a very scary time. The fact something like that could happen here was very traumatic and the manner in which it happened was very upsetting.” Fred Gaines, a member of the Calabasas City Council, said the community had “a very, very low crime rate and an extremely low violent crime rate.” “To have an incident where someone is shot and killed is extremely rare,” Mr. Gaines said. “To have an unknown shooter in the community was of significant concern and for some people it was very frightening.” The area has been repeatedly shaken in recent months, first by the killing of Mr. Beaudette and then by the Woolsey Fire, which burned parts of both towns and tore through the verdant canyon park in November. That same month, 12 people were killed in a mass shooting at a country music bar in the nearby town of Thousand Oaks. “Following the shooting in Thousand Oaks and the fire that devastated our area, I am really grateful for the hard work of law enforcement who put this to rest,” said Skylar Peak, a member of the Malibu City Council. In a statement, prosecutors said the attacks began in November 2016 when the gunman shot James Rogers, who was sleeping in a hammock in the park. The gunman fired into the sleeping area of a parked vehicle less than a week later, they said, and then shot at vehicles in or near the park three times in 2017. No one was injured in those attacks. Prosecutors said the attacker again shot at a car last June as it drove down Las Virgenes Road, a major thoroughfare that forms part of the park’s eastern border, but no one was injured. The gunman encountered Mr. Beaudette in a tent with his children four days later, on June 22. A camper elsewhere in the park reported hearing gunfire at around 4:45 a.m. on the day Mr. Beaudette was killed, the authorities said in June. When deputies arrived at the camp site, which Mr. Gaines said is plainly visible from Las Virgenes Road, they found Mr. Beaudette with at least one gunshot wound in his upper torso. He was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said. “The grief and trauma this loss has caused our close-knit family is indescribable,” Mr. Beaudette’s family said in a statement released at the time of his death. “A scientist who loved cooking and microbrews, Tristan was happiest out in nature and spent every chance he could hiking, biking, snowboarding and camping with his family.” The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said Mr. Rauda was also charged in five burglaries that occurred in the Calabasas area last year. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor declined to say how law enforcement had connected Mr. Rauda to all of the shootings and burglaries, and a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. The Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office said it would represent him, although a lawyer had not been assigned to his case by Monday."
47,"The freshest battleground in the U.S.-China trade war is currently playing out in Canada, where the CFO of Huawei faces extradition for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Why it matters: This is both deeply personal (CFO Wanzhou Meng is the daughter of Huawei's founder) and precarious, given the accusations. The U.S. nearly gave ZTE a death sentence for similar allegations earlier this year, before President Trump backed off. Details: The allegations are strongly disputed by Meng's attorneys.  Between 2009 to 2014, Huawei used Skycom Tech to make transactions in Iran, a violation of American sanctions against Iran, per the New York Times.  ""Huawei operated Skycom as an unofficial subsidiary, making efforts to keep the connection between the companies secret,"" per the Times.  Banks in the U.S., then inadvertently did business with Skycom when they cleared financial transactions for Huawei.  Between the lines, via Axios China's Bill Bishop: ""The arrest will probably not derail the U.S.-China trade talks."" ""That could change if there are additional U.S. moves against Huawei, especially if they come from the executive branch."" ""Any foreign and especially U.S. tech firm that has supply chain reliance on China needs to be deep into planning for reducing that reliance, no matter how hard, painful and expensive such a shift would be.""

Bottom line: This could be a real test case for whether the U.S. will have teeth in its challenge of Chinese tech aspirations."

49,"COSCUEZ, Colombia (Reuters) - Workers at the Colombian emerald mine run by Canada’s Fura Gems’ - the first publicly-traded emerald miner operating in the South American nation - have been laboring in unsafe conditions and sometimes lack basic safety equipment, according to four former employees. Fura set out early last year to revive production at the fabled, four-century-old Coscuez mine, once the Andean country’s largest producer of the gem. The Toronto-based company promised to operate by the book in a province known for organized crime and dangerous wildcat mining but the sources - who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals - said it had been falling short. The former employees said managers at Fura ignored repeated requests to provide staff with equipment like masks and safety glasses. Fura managers at the mine denied staff were working without proper equipment. Fura spokeswoman Rosey Perkins said: “All allegations concerning safety and especially our employees are taken seriously.” “We are in the process of mechanizing the mine and adapting operations and safety standards to comply with Colombian and broader international regulations,” Perkins said. The alleged problems at Coscuez illustrate the challenges for Colombia in properly regulating miners, as it seeks to garner investment from big-name gold and gem companies. Colombia’s National Mining Agency (ANM) - which regulates the sector - told Reuters it was carrying out a rare sanction process against the company, which was at the notification stage. ANM inspectors most recently visited the mine in March. Fura managers said they were unaware of the sanction and the ANM declined to provide further details. The agency said, however, the fine was equivalent to about $4,900. Around 6% of mines in Colombia are fined or shuttered per year, it added. The ANM said it made recommendations regarding worker equipment and asked Fura to adjust ventilation in the mine tunnel, but did not provide specifics. Fura’s license expires in December 2020. The ANM said that its policy was not to consider the viability of any renewal unless a mine is complying with all regulations. About 120 of Fura’s employees work underground. Miners work 12-hour shifts for 14 days, the company said, then take seven days off. About 70% of the company’s workers are lacking at least one piece of equipment, according to one source familiar with Fura’s safety measures. Workers are given a mish-mash of supplies - for example, assigned emergency oxygen masks but no gloves - the ex-employee said. During an unannounced visit to the mine, Reuters reporters were taken on a tour steps behind a third-party inspector hired by the mine, who was on a scheduled visit. Reuters saw three jackhammer operators without eye protection in a tunnel and many workers who were not wearing the top part of their safety overalls. Some miners had no gloves or gas masks. When asked by Reuters whether they were provided with eye protection, one of the jackhammer operators said he reported his broken glasses but had not received a replacement. The mine’s managing director Rahul Gopal, who accompanied Reuters on the tour, said there was “no chance” workers were going without needed equipment, adding that not all workers required every piece of gear. Workers in Fura’s mine have repeatedly been hurt by falling rocks because they lacked protective gear, the former employees said. They said in one incident falling rocks hurt a worker’s feet, while other employees have suffered cuts. Another employee suffered burns on his back after being scalded by hot water, one of his former colleagues said. Deputy general manager Alcides Paiva said there were 45 accidents between January and mid-September, ranging from trivial incidents to more serious ones. Fura confirmed details about the burned worker and showed Reuters reports on workers injured by falling rocks and an overturned vehicle. During the nine months of 2018 that the mine was operating, there were 53 accidents, he added. The ANM said it only keeps records for more serious emergencies where a worker’s life was endangered. On average in recent years, there has been 86 such emergencies annually across Colombia’s mining industry, it said. The labor ministry said it had a record of only one accident - classified as “serious” - at Fura so far this year and said it had no knowledge of the other allegations.

		Andy is dedicated to building a better reality while working in augmented reality since before AR was a thing. He is CMO of Wikitude. In Tim Cook’s recent exclusive interview with ABC, he gave us insight into what he thinks the “digital you” will do. He specifically mentions real-time meetings in real spaces — “this gives the capability for both of us to be very present and be talking to each other, and have other things — visually — for both of us to see,” said Cook — acknowledging the all-too-obvious first use of a digital you. But what else is there? Having been lucky enough to have met my digital self (see below) thanks to a company called Cappasity, I have some thoughts. Like humans, the digital you (AKA holoportation) will go through an evolution. No, Scotty won’t be beaming me or you to Klingon to do battle like Captain Kirk — but pretty damn close. The first step? It probably won’t be the “Skype on steroids” that Cook alluded to. That technology — your digital avatar moving in the real world, in real time — requires multiple camera angles, serious computing power and the right equipment to watch, at least in the short term. For consumers, the digital you will evolve a little differently. First, we will see non-interactive, static 3D models — you’ll be trying on clothes without even getting out of bed. Companies like European online clothing giant Zalando were trying this — even three years ago. That can evolve into dynamic 3D models — the digital you will be able to move, and maybe talk. Next, you’ll get animated and go virtual. Wearing a VR headset like HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, your digital you can be present in virtual spaces to have a date, collaborate with colleagues or play a game. Check out Mark Zuckerberg playing ping pong, or, see what Mimesys is doing — they are working on enabling real-time holoportation in VR. While the quality of the person’s rendering is still rough, there is no question that it will be perfected over time. This could get pretty fun, too — imagine the viral-hit animated renderings of apps like MSQRD or Snapchat (which is rumored to be making an AR wearable) on a full-size scale. (If I built the first human-size digital you animation app, I’d be inclined to name it after the shape-shifting Polyjuice Potion from Harry Potter!) But let’s go where Tim took us: not virtual reality, but augmented reality; if you will, reality-reality. Back to what he said: “[Augmented Reality] gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things — visually — for both of us to see.” So video chat — in the real world. He continues: “Maybe it’s something we’re talking about, maybe it’s someone else here, who’s not here present, but who can be made to appear to be present.” The future is arriving faster than ever — and virtual people made out of pixels will be here before you know it. It’s an interesting (and obvious) stipulation — there’s no question that accessible video chat like Skype or FaceTime has evolved the way we communicate with those far from us, whether it’s colleagues or friends and family. But I think Tim’s holding back. What else could the digital you do? Whether or not Elon Musk is right and we are all living in a simulation, it’s time for me — the real me — to speculate. Let’s take a tip from House of Cards, and follow the money: Where’s the income stream? It’s a great question. In the case of Skype on steroids, it’s a service. Beyond that? It seems that the end user is either the consumer, or, potentially, the product (in the manner that Facebook users are the product). For retailers like Amazon or Zalando — or anyone selling clothes, accessories or wearables — the application is immediate and obvious: increase sales with deeper market penetration and more connected customer conversation. But what next? The possibilities are interesting: celebrity visits in your home, virtual gaming environments (except the environment isn’t virtual, it’s your living room) or even education — ballet lessons, lectures and more. There’s even a real-world example: If you’re a HoloLens developer, you can play with the appropriately chosen George Takei, anywhere you please. As you can see, Microsoft has already started playing in this space. In addition to the George Takei giggle, they also ran a little experiment with NASA — and have advanced the technology even more to create the video below, which is a bit more complicated than what they’ve done by teleporting Takei. This brings us to the interesting dichotomy of the digital you: there are two. The one others (and you) can observe, and the one you experience — where your eyes are replaced by cameras, and your ears by microphones. Which raises the question: How far can it go? Can haptic sensors let the digital you... feel? Are we talking the NSFW scene with Sandra Bullock and Sylvester Stallone in Demolition Man? Given the porn industry’s history of tech innovation, the answer is, probably — but adding in haptics, smell or 3D audio can have other benefits, too. Once those cameras and sensors can capture other environments accurately enough, you can be places you aren’t. For instance, in a nuclear waste area, or in training for a war zone... any time you want to experience or manipulate the meatspace without actually being turned into ground beef. The other question: Can the digital you do one job, while you do another? Depends. Driving and texting clearly has bad repercussions. But even though we should probably limit multitasking to walking and chewing bubble gum, it is possible, to a degree. However, much of the multitasking limit may come from our RAM-deficient human grey matter, not technology. A college professor probably can’t teach physics in one classroom and mathematics in another. But can a homeowner paint his deck while balancing his budget? Or weed the garden while delivering a lecture? Maybe. Where it does clearly work, though, is when one simply needs to appear in two (or more) places at once — great for a CEO who needs to present to shareholders or investors, or politicians meeting and greeting citizens. Moral questions above notwithstanding, the existence of the digital you gives rise to a few other concerns: namely, can the digital you be hacked? The answer here is clearly yes. Anything we choose to throw up online is going to be vulnerable. How does the digital you get verified? Do you need a digital passport? Are we all going to need Base 58 binary-to-text encoding à la bitcoin? Part of this depends on how quickly the technology advances, what we are doing with it and how responsible we treat this unstoppable development. The digital you probably will not be signing checks any time soon, but it is not hard to imagine hackers and scammers achieving impressive new levels of old-school social engineering hacks — if you were worried about Granny giving away the bank to a scam artist, it might be even harder to resist if said scammer looks like you and is sitting in her living room. The good news? While it might be very easy to mimic the appearance of someone, voice and intonation are probably a bit more difficult. The best defense against criminalizing the digital you might simply be the people you know. The truth is that most of us will probably be most fascinated by meeting and seeing real (at least, appearing to be real) people — we want to see our friends, kids and family, and be transported to a place where they are, if only digitally. Eventually, I think that immersive experience — sharing a setting, a location, essentially occupying a mutual space — means the digital you will eventually exist beyond virtual reality and move into augmented reality. This, I believe, is the ultimate use case — although not necessarily the most common, or useful — simply the most evolved form.  Just think what companies like Magic Leap can do if speculation about their hardware is true! If that is how great minds like Cook see holoportation helping in the future, I agree with him. As to when that will become a real reality, we can only make predictions. If the past three decades have taught us one thing, it is that the future is arriving faster than ever — and virtual people made out of pixels will be here before you know it. But, much of this depends on hardware, and the price of said hardware. One thing we do know? The two big players, Microsoft and Apple, are in. Tim’s talking the talk and walking the walk — Apple is investing big in AR, and he clearly says in comparison to VR that “my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.”  So even though you may know yourself pretty well, get ready — soon you’ll also meet your own digital you. Although I am guessing Tim will have the chance to meet his, first — if he hasn’t already."
53,"As if the 2022 World Cup wasn't enough of a debacle already, officials have announced what sports fans often fear most: No booze allowed.  That's right. Public consumption of alcohol will be banned at the tournament in Qatar. That includes drinking inside stadiums and outside on the streets, according to the officials governing the 2022 World Cup, which said this week that providing alcohol in public is against the ""values and traditions"" of their culture.  But prohibition is hardly the lone fiasco of the 2022 World Cup.  First of all, the tournament will take place in November and December to avoid Qatar's blazing summer heat. That's fine, but it conflicts with many players' club team seasons And for United States viewers, the tournament broadcast competes with the professional and collegiate football and basketball seasons. In bleaker news, workers building the stadiums died at a rate of one person every two days, according to The Guardian. There were also issues with punctual payment. Finally, the bidding process for Qatar to host in the first place was allegedly shady. Brazil tried to ban alcohol before the 2014 World Cup, but then-FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke wasn't having it.  “Alcoholic drinks are part of the FIFA World Cup, so we’re going to have them,” he told the Washington Post. “Excuse me if I sound a bit arrogant but that’s something we won’t negotiate.” The 2022 World Cup is already a disaster. And now fans can't even drink to numb the pain. "
54,"ATLANTA — Gerardo Martino looked relaxed Wednesday morning, an hour before his unveiling as the first coach of Atlanta United, the Major League Soccer expansion team scheduled to begin play in March. Dressed in a tailored black suit, a European collar on his white shirt, he smiled readily as he discussed tactics, players and plans. The only sign that he was about to stand in front of a room of reporters was a cheat sheet on a table nearby bearing a few words of greeting in English — a language that Martino, an Argentine, has yet to learn. An hour later, Martino, 53, who is known as Tata, became one of the most qualified coaches in M.L.S. history. In 2010, he led Paraguay to its best World Cup finish; in 2013, he was named coach of the Spanish giant F.C. Barcelona; and in 2015 and 2016, he directed Argentina to consecutive Copa América finals. None of those experiences, however, offered him what his multiyear contract with Atlanta United did: a chance, he said in Spanish, “to begin a project from zero.” Indeed, since arriving in Atlanta on Monday afternoon to formally accept his new job, Martino has visited training sessions of youth academy teams that have existed only for a few months and a stadium and a training center that are still under construction. The team he will send onto the field in less than six months is unfinished, too; Atlanta has only seven players at the moment, most notably the Argentine midfielder Hector Villalba, who is known as Tito and is currently on loan at the Mexican club Tijuana. Asked how success might be measured for him a year from now, Martino said: “That my players have a clear idea of how I want them to play, and that the fans feel a sense of identification with what they’re seeing on the field. “The more players buy into what I’m trying to do, the more likely it is we’ll win games.” Standing nearby, the Atlanta United president, Darren Eales, described Martino’s style as “fast and fluid, with pace and attacking — like Pochettino.” He was referring to Mauricio Pochettino, the coach at Tottenham in the Premier League, where Eales served as executive director before joining Atlanta United in 2014. Martino and Pochettino have known each other for decades, having played together at the Argentine club Newell’s Old Boys. Pochettino was one of the “mutual friends” Martino said he had spoken with in the last few months to gather opinions about both Eales and the Atlanta United coaching job. Martino has been without a team after resigning as Argentina’s manager in July amid public disputes related to the country’s defeat in last summer’s Copa América Centenario, player frustration about the leadership of the national federation and Argentina’s preparations for the Rio Olympics. Martino acknowledged that he had not seen M.L.S. games, or studied the league, before he was approached about working in it. He said he had known of its reputation for physical play, and of its penchant for marquee signings from Europe, and he named a handful of Argentines who had burnished their reputation in the league, including Ignacio Piatti (Montreal), Maxi Urruti (Portland) and Mauro Rosales (F.C. Dallas). But Martino also said he was not aware that foreign coaches — well-traveled veterans like Bora Milutinovic and Carlos Alberto Perreira or former players like Ruud Gullit and Aron Winter — had a history of posting underwhelming results in M.L.S. That could be changing: The Colombian Oscar Pareja has built a respected foundation in Dallas, and Martino noted the success of Patrick Vieira, the Frenchman who has led New York City F.C. to its first playoff berth. He is keenly aware of the difference between working under the glare of global soccer — even the president of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, weighed in on Martino’s resignation this summer — and leading an M.L.S. team, especially in an area of the country that has never fielded a team in the league. “I’ll have the peace and quiet, during the week, to concentrate on the weekend’s game,” he said. “It’s important to escape all the gossip and focus on what matters — the game.” Still, the diverse and complex means of acquiring players in M.L.S. — including drafts and international claims, so-called homegrown youth players and big-money designated player signings — can be mind-bending for coaches used to simply buying the players they need. Martino said it was important that Atlanta United already had a staff — including the technical director Carlos Bocanegra and the director of soccer operations Paul McDonough, who helped Orlando City get its team off the ground last season — to help him get up to speed on the system. Martino underlined the importance of youth player development at his new club “based on how I became a player at Newell’s.” The club is known for grooming players, including a young Lionel Messi, who played for Martino with Barcelona and Argentina. “Working with the youth teams is fundamental for me, no matter where in the world I’m coaching,” he said. Kelly Carter, president of the Atlanta chapter of American Outlaws, the United States national team fan group, noted after Wednesday’s news conference with Martino that Andrew Carleton, Atlanta United’s 16-year-old homegrown player, had scored Tuesday night for the under-17 national team in a victory against Panama. As the teenager Christian Pulisic has blossomed into a national team regular by getting first-team minutes at Germany’s Borussia Dortmund, there has been growing pressure for M.L.S. to get its own young Americans onto the field more, and earlier. Signing a youth-focused mentor like Martino, Carter said, could be “very important for the development of the league and the quality of coaches.” Although the club does not disclose salary details, Martino allowed that he would be earning considerably less at his new job than when he coached Barcelona, where a salary of about $5.8 million had made him among the best-paid soccer coaches in the world. “But the proposal they’re offering me — to install my style of play and build from the ground up — is worth more than money,” he said."
55,"Tapachula (CNN)The air is thick with humidity on the Suchiate River that separates Mexico from Guatemala. Yet the pontoon men are busy as usual. Using long poles, they strain as they push wooden rafts lashed to huge inner tubes from one bank to the other, illegally but openly ferrying goods and humans from one country to the other for the equivalent of just over a dollar a head.  This is how many migrants enter Mexico on their journey north to the United States. They come from many places, but mainly the ""Northern Triangle"" countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.  Increasingly, they come from other nations too, including Cuba, Haiti, and a number of African nations. These are the people US President Donald Trump -- using tariffs as a weapon -- has demanded Mexico somehow halt in their tracks.  In our time on the river and in the nearby town of Tapachula, we meet many migrants. They tell us they want the world to know they're not numbers, that they have names and lives they don't want cut short.  Amid so many heartbreaking cases, the Gonzalez Trejo family from Honduras stood out: The matriarch, Juana Isabel wept as she told us that three generations of the family -- the youngest just five months old -- had been sleeping on the streets for more than a week in the stifling heat and afternoon downpours, waiting for their next processing appointment, still nearly a month away.    They will spend that month on the sidewalk, with no money to pay for accommodation, she told us.  Juana Isabel said gangs murdered her husband when he didn't pay a gang ""tax"". Her son-in-law, a bus driver, said he was also the victim of demands to pay gang ""taxes"" and, when he didn't, the thugs fired multiple shots into his bus. The final straw was a note pinned to the family's front door the next day. ""Everyone get out. You have 24 hours to leave with your family. If not, we will kill you,"" the note said. The family fled, heading north into Mexico and their life on the streets, waiting to be processed and -- they pray -- get permission to stay in Mexico for now.  ""I feel bad -- I feel shattered to know how our country is now,"" Juana Isabel told us.   ""I never thought my country would ever be this way. I cry because of the situation we're now living here,"" she said in tears, her voice cracking. Others have come from much further abroad. On June 15, our team received word of a disturbance at a local detention center called ""Feria Internacional Mesoamericana"". As we approached, dozens of mainly African migrants ran toward us, screaming and wailing as marines and police tried unsuccessfully to hold them back. Separated from the rest of the world by a gate, one woman who refused to give her name described the people detained inside. ""Cameroon, there are Ghanaians, there are Nigerians, there are Congo, Angolans, there are so many Africans, Bangladesh, there are Indians,"" she told us. ""There are so many people in there."" Originally from Cameroon, she said that she took a flight to Colombia before ending up here, but that others fly to Brazil and other places in the region. When we asked how she paid for it and who organized the trip, she suddenly stopped talking and turned away. Mexico says the migrant crisis is a six billion dollar a year industry. She also complained of poor conditions at the center—an issue that the Mexican government has acknowledged, promising improvements and renovations for some holding facilities.  A job too big for Mexico alone To stem the flow of migrants entering Mexico and traveling onwards to the United States, the Mexican government has promised to send six thousand National Guard to enforce its southern border, among other things. However, it had already failed to do so by the stated June 18 deadline, and since conceded that perhaps only 50 percent of the troops would be in place by June 22.   As we traveled the area, border control officers were few and far between. Most were not the promised National Guard, but rather Federal Police, army or marines, some wearing arm bands with the letters GN to signify that they were proxies for National Guard forces. The Mexican government's difficulty in fulfilling its promise speaks to the monumental task at hand: The border between Mexico and Guatemala stretches for 870 kilometers (540 miles). With mountains, forests and any number of potential river crossing points, policing it is a tough assignment. As President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's administration has said, shrinking the migration flow is a job Mexico cannot do alone; it is a regional issue requiring a regional response. Mexico has called on the UN and US to help, as well as the countries where these migrants begin their journeys.   Still, Mexico has detained thousands of migrants, deported many more and pledged to do what it can to placate the Trump administration. The number of checkpoints on the road to Tapachula has increased in recent days, and more and more migrants are being detained at them. At a highway overpass, immigration officers, under the watch of marines and federal police, stop virtually all taxis and mini buses, checking the occupants. Every now and then a migrant's dream is shattered, or at least interrupted, as they are taken away to detention and processing centers. At this one checkpoint, sometimes 100 dreams end this way each day, we are told. The people removed from vehicles at this checkpoint are mainly young men and women, who look resigned as their journey ends with detention. Some are eligible for a Mexican humanitarian visa which will allow them to continue traveling north as they attempt to enter the US. Those who don't receive the visas are taken to detention centers for further processing and, in many cases, are deported. The root of the problem At Tapachula's Fray Matías de Córdova human rights center, a privately funded NGO, volunteers play with children while parents receive legal counsel. Salva Lacruz, the center's coordinator, says he's seen more migrants in the past five months than the previous three years combined. Many factors feed into this surge, including increased violence in origin countries like Honduras, drought, and recent publicity around so-called ""caravans"" of civilians walking north to the US border. We ask Lacruz if sending troops to Mexico's southern border is the answer.  ""No, no -- because these people need protection, they don't need more violence, more detention, deportation -- sent back to violence in their countries,"" he says shaking his head. His words echo what many of the migrants tell us: The problems that need solving aren't in Mexico, nor on the US border. They're in the countries these people fled. The violence, corruption and structural decay that literally puts their very lives at risk exist in those places and, along with economic factors as well, drives people to run north.    ""Nobody is going to stop,"" says Ricardo, a migrant from El Salvador we met in the area.  ""It's like someone trying to take away air, trying to do something that is impossible."" ""They can send 10, 20, 1000 lines of soldiers, but we will always migrate because our countries are badly governed -- because there is no life.""  "
56,"Opinion Finally, something worse than Donald Trump. CreditCreditFox Photos/Getty Images Opinion Columnist Congress may have found an issue that all Americans can rally around. Stopping robocalls. All right — a little depressing that it can’t be world peace or affordable health care. But let’s take what we can get. If our elected officials could join hands and lead us into a world where phones are no longer an instrument of torture, maybe it’d give them enough confidence to march forward and, um, fund some bridge repair. Everybody has always hated telemarketers, particularly the ones trying to sell some shady product. And now the miracles of technology let them follow you around all day. When I’m home, I feel as if I spend half my time blocking robocalls on our landline. Yet somehow a different number always pops up, with great news about opportunities to reinsure my nonexistent car at low prices or acquire a cost-free knee brace. The knee brace thing is a scam to get money out of Medicare, but in order to figure that out you’d have to engage in conversation. People, do not ever talk on the phone with a stranger wielding free knee braces. This can be a life rule. Things are at least as bad on mobile phones, which were the lucky recipients of 48 billion robocalls in the United States alone last year. Congress has been trying to control the problem at least since 1991, when it passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Remember 1991? “Dances With Wolves” won the Oscar for best picture. The Dow closed the year at 3,168. The point I’m trying to make is that it’s been a while. At the time the big problem was mainly telemarketers — actual people who dialed your actual number and tried to talk you into buying something. Under the T.C.P.A. you could put your name on a national “do not call” list. Some observers did worry about the part of the plan that required the list be maintained by the telemarketers themselves. Whoops. In 2003 Congress gave the job to the Federal Trade Commission. Then-President George W. Bush signed the bill into law, rejoicing that from then on, when parents were reading to their children at night, they’d no longer be interrupted by “a stranger with a sales pitch.” Then robocalls really took over the world, and one person on the other side of the planet could push a few buttons and disrupt “Goodnight Moon” from coast to coast. The F.T.C. kept saying it could take care of the problem. (“... you can count on us ...”) Then the Federal Communications Commission created the Robocall Strike Force in 2016. Great name! Mediocre results. So here we are, tortured phone owners one and all. Perhaps, like me, you’ve accidentally blocked some of your friends without successfully getting rid of the woman with the free knee brace. Perhaps you were like Dr. Gary Pess, a hand surgeon who told The Times’s Tara Siegel Bernard that he stopped answering any calls when he didn’t recognize the number and then discovered one of them was about a person with a severed thumb. But good news! We’re getting some action. I know “Congress is working on a bill” is not as encouraging as, say, “Let me pour you a drink and change the subject.” But still. In the House, Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey has a proposal called Stopping Bad Robocalls, which certainly gets to the point. Pallone is the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and it’s fair to say he has a healthy chance of getting something done. Things are more problematic in the Senate, which, as you may have noticed, is barely capable of getting its act together long enough to salute the flag. However, Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts — the man who helped give us that Telephone Consumer Protection Act in 1991 — has teamed up with Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota to sponsor a bipartisan plan. It’s called the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act, which I certainly hope you noticed spells out Traced. (Or, O.K., Traceda if you wanted to be really technical.) The bill, Markey says, is “a perfect example” of lawmakers from opposite sides of the aisle getting together and “agreeing we don’t want our wireless devices in our pocket to be called by total strangers 10, 15 times a day.” Pretty low bar, yes? Perhaps someday we will see a liberal from California and a conservative from Arkansas get together to fight against people who throw beer bottles out of their car window when they’re in the passing lane on the highway. But let’s not be cynical. Markey says, “If this bill can’t pass then no bill can pass,” and he’s probably right. You need to root him on, given that the other option is falling back in your chair and moaning, “No bill can pass.” Come on. The idea is to make telephone companies try much harder to identify and block slimy robocalls. And to bring enforcement groups together to find new ways to prosecute the scammers. I know it doesn’t sound all that dramatic, but if you want people to stop calling you every day with offers to repay your student loans, it’s a better strategy than repeatedly screaming “I graduated in 1980!” into the phone.

57,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors betting on policy easing from global central banks committed money to emerging equity funds for the first time in five months this week and also bought more junk-rated bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday. Central bank policies have spurred “risk-on”, BAML’s weekly flows report said, noting $4.5 billion had flowed to global equity funds - a 10-week high - while junk bonds took $2.9 billion, the biggest three-week inflow streak in three years. BAML said the numbers reflected “inflows to weak dollar plays”, namely emerging markets and high-yield bonds, though gold, traditionally viewed as a safe haven from uncertainty, is also benefiting. The dollar has lost about 2 percent in 2016 to a currency basket .DXY as U.S. rate hike bets have been scaled back. The BAML report said emerging debt funds took in $1.1 billion, the largest inflow in a year while EM equities received $1.7 billion, the most since July 2015. U.S. equity funds took their first money in 10 weeks at $3.9 billion. Government bond funds saw their third week of outflows, shedding $1.4 billion. Markets are predicting just one U.S. rate hike by end-2016. But the European Central Bank cut rates deeper into negative territory this week and the Bank of Japan will likely do the same in coming days. Reaction to the ECB on Thursday was underwhelming, however, with the euro ending the day stronger on signals more rate cuts are not on the cards. BAML said the flow figures and the ECB reaction showed the risk rally was “topping”, as it had been driven solely by central bank expectations. “Central banks have played the ‘rates card’ as aggressively as they can; ECB is done, BoJ has nothing in the tank, and any U.S. macro strength will elicit Fed rate hike expectations,” it added. Possibly reflecting the uncertain mood, gold stayed in demand for the ninth straight week, taking in $1 billion - its longest inflow streak since October 2012.

58,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House’s budget chief came under fire on Thursday from Democrats and others over his attack on the budget research office of the U.S. Congress, escalating tensions between Republicans and professional staffers on Capitol Hill. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney called “absurd” a recent finding by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that a Republican healthcare bill would cause 23 million people to lose health insurance coverage. In an interview on Wednesday with the Washington Examiner, a conservative newspaper, Mulvaney said, “At some point, you’ve got to ask yourself, has the day of the CBO come and gone?” Steny Hoyer, a Democratic House of Representatives leader, in a statement called Mulvaney’s comments “irresponsible and unacceptable” and an “indication of a bully mentality.” The CBO is one of a handful of analysis units of Congress whose employees strive for political impartiality, providing dependable and neutral information that lawmakers can use when making often complex budget, tax and other decisions. President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans, including Mulvaney, have been frustrated with the CBO’s findings about their proposals to roll back Obamacare, the healthcare system put in place by then-Democratic President Barack Obama formally known as the Affordable Care Act. “When Trump administration officials either disagree with or do not understand the impacts of their own policies, they prefer to attack the nonpartisan analysts who are doing their jobs with integrity and expertise,” Hoyer said in a statement. Representative John Yarmuth, also a Democrat, said that Mulvaney had impugned the integrity of a CBO analyst in charge of the healthcare assessment and urged Mulvaney to apologize. The CBO was created in 1974 during a spending dispute between the Democratic-controlled Congress and Republican President Richard Nixon after he withheld funds for government programs that did not support his political positions. A CBO spokeswoman declined to comment on Thursday. Former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican who headed the office under President George W. Bush, said it was not unusual for the office to become a “political football.” “What’s unusual here is to have the sitting OMB director attack the integrity, the core of the institution,” he said. An OMB spokesperson could not be reached for comment. Reporting By Amanda Becker; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Jonathan Oatis"

61,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this year’s Christmas present to the donor class, is an abomination. Its top-heavy distribution of cuts, its wasteful mistargeting of incentives, and its funding of permanent corporate tax cuts via tax hikes on millions of ordinary taxpayers have been widely publicized. From the other direction, whatever virtues the bill might have are completely swamped by its trillion-dollar plus impact on government deficits. But before moving on, we should review some of the process through which this bill was fashioned. Over the long haul, the politicization and perversion of what had been a bipartisan approach to tax lawmaking will prove at least as damaging as the substance of this bill. Further, the debates surrounding who will pay how much as a result of the legislation reveal that the standard tools used to make these judgments are in need of revision.   The tax code can best be understood as an enormously complex economic model of all of economic activity: Whatever you do in the real world, no matter what the economic activity, pulls a lever or pushes a button inside the model and out spits a tax bill. The tax legislation process therefore has always rested on a foundation of expertise in the form of lawyers and public finance economists deeply immersed in the technical minutiae of the tax code and in its impact on economic behavior. This expertise is centralized in two places: the Treasury Department and the staff of the Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan tax law and economics resource to Congress. These experts are committed to acting as honest agents to their respective bosses and to the taxpaying public. But this time, these authentic pools of expertise have largely been ignored. Normally, there are multiple congressional hearings, proposed statutory language and detailed reports from the tax-writing committees, all prepared well in advance of any vote. These are prepared with the assistance of JCT staff and with the input of Treasury Department experts. Regular order offers experts inside and outside the government an opportunity to study the legislation and to call to the drafters’ attention drafting mistakes and unintended consequences, both of which bedevil any first draft of a tax bill. This time, the process has been so rushed and so secret that the Senate early Saturday morning voted on legislation that in part comprised handwritten amendments stuck into the bill, the contents of which were neither known nor understood by virtually any of the Senators called on to vote. Tax experts outside government already are finding both unintended opportunities and inappropriate tax penalties in the hundreds of pages of hastily drafted legislation. But the problems run much deeper than the breakneck schedule. The JCT staff’s most visible contributions to the tax legislation process are its revenue and distribution tables. Revenue tables summarize, provision by provision, the estimated increased or decreased revenues that could be expected from proposed tax legislation, relative to leaving things as they are; these are Congress’ official scorecards for the budgetary impact of tax legislation. Democrat Warner calls Senate tax vote ‘Swamp 101’ as GOP insists there was transparency https://t.co/a58ZTmEbC6 pic.twitter.com/2i3ms7JchS The distribution tables show how much more or less different classes of taxpayers (ranked by incomes) can be expected to pay. The process this time revealed weaknesses in JCT distribution table methodologies that deserve a rethink. As one simple example, JCT staff distributional analyses typically limit themselves to income tax matters and therefore ignore the distributional implications of changes to the estate tax. The JCT staff followed that precedent in its distribution tables for the House bill. But while there may be reason to ignore relatively small changes to the estate tax, outright repeal is both expensive and an extremely top-heavy distribution of tax goodies. It also is easily distributed to taxpayers, as it affects only the most affluent. It should be included. Another more complex example relates to the inconsistent treatment of the bill’s repeal of the individual mandate in the JCT revenue and distribution tables. Finally, the JCT staff prepares a macroeconomic revenue projection. This is an enormously complex undertaking that attempts, to the best ability of economists’ current consensus understanding, to measure how a large-scale tax bill might affect the overall growth path of the U.S. economy, as well as shifts within the economy. Doing it right requires consideration of all the interaction effects within a tax bill, and across both domestic and cross-border economies. The House majority did not wait for a JCT staff macroeconomic analysis and instead relied on any private estimate that suited its fancy, without the slightest consideration of that unvetted private model’s biases or shortcomings. The Senate essentially did the same, as the JCT staff macroeconomic analysis was completed only the day before the Senate’s late-night vote. Most distressingly, so did Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, whose career economists are the only government resource beyond the JCT staff actually capable of undertaking a comprehensive macroeconomic analysis of how all these major tax amendments would map onto taxpayer behavior. The New York Times exposed as a lie Mnuchin’s claims that teams of Treasury experts were working feverishly on such an analysis, and the Treasury inspector general has now opened an investigation of these claims.

The Senate tax bill is stuffed with provisions for special interests. @juliannagoldman reports on what items are buried in the legislation. https://t.co/pKPy9ZYJqW pic.twitter.com/AfmcvANdCJ “We think they lowballed” future economic growth, he said; based on what? His personal macroeconomic model running in his basement? Sen. Cornyn then demonstrated everything one really needs to know about the Senate majority’s commitment to transparency and fairness when he inserted at the very last minute a provision into the Senate bill to extend to passive investors in publicly traded master limited partnerships (MLPs) the benefits of the new 23-percent haircut in tax rates that the bill now bestows on active “pass-through” businesses. MLPs are very large public companies, indistinguishable from the public corporations with which they compete. They are particularly visible in certain natural resources businesses, like oil and gas pipelines, a point that just might have been relevant to the senator from Texas. These MLP financial vehicles already operate at a tremendous tax advantage over other publicly-traded businesses, because they are the only public companies that are allowed to escape paying corporate income tax. But that existing subsidy was insufficient for Sen. Cornyn, and now existing investors in such vehicles have been awarded a further windfall by becoming eligible for the new discounted pass-through tax rates sold as tax relief for Main Street business. Interestingly, the JCT revenue estimate for all the last-minute amendments folded this change into the larger revision in the rate of the tax subsidy for pass-throughs, so that its cost remains hidden. How many senators knew that this provision was in the bill when they voted for it that night? Or knew what a master limited partnership even was? My pockets have been picked, and so have yours, by this theft of our revenues to line the pockets of existing investors in these arcane instruments.

RIGHT AFTER THE WEATHER By Carol Anshaw Late in Carol Anshaw’s new novel, there’s a chapter set at the 2017 Women’s March in Chicago that consists of a single paragraph. It’s entitled “pussy hat”: “Cate is not going to wear the hat. She is extremely unhappy with the new president and fired up to be marching in protest of his election, and thrilled with the size of the crowd they join coming up out of the el at Jackson, but she’s not going to wear the hat. She thinks it brings the symbolic discourse down to his level. She doesn’t want this to be a problem between her and the person who knitted the hat for her, but it has started them off on the wrong marching foot. And then there is also this person’s — Maureen’s — sign to contend with. It features the president groping the Statue of Liberty. While its message is sound, its graphic is a little, well, graphic. Cate walks a short way off, to distance herself from the sign.” This is a very good example of a phenomenon Freud called the narcissism of small differences. In his words: “It is precisely the minor differences in people who are otherwise alike that form the basis of feelings of hostility between them.” And “Right After the Weather” does a very good — which is to say very uncomfortable — job of exploring the way our desire for connection and approval swims against the tide of our propensity to judge and feel judged by those who are close to us. The first half of the book plays out like a somewhat meandering tragicomedy of minor calibrations and recalibrations. Any little surges of tenderness are inevitably yanked back by fits of schadenfreude. Cate, a 42-year-old designer of theatrical sets, is living a life of quiet dissatisfaction. Some of this is probably innate; she’s not the most warmhearted person you ever met. She has long enjoyed “watching extremely fat people — imagining what they eat when they’re alone, how they manage sex.” She converts her irritation with a friend’s father into “permission to look a little too long at his abundance of protruding ear hair.” And — call it a professional hazard — she routinely evaluates people negatively on the basis of their home décor. When we meet her, she’s navigating a few external challenges as well. The play she’s working on is crummy. The woman she’s dating is annoying. Her best friend occasions her envy; her former girlfriend occasions her lust; and her financial situation occasions her woe, even though she lives in an apartment bought for her by her ex-husband. Said ex, Graham, has recently moved in with her, just until he can get “back on his feet after his most recent marital breakup.” He’s holed himself up in her spare bedroom, where he indulges a sweaty, round-the-clock obsession with internet conspiracy theories. The novel takes place during the months leading up to and following the 2016 presidential election. Against this backdrop, what might otherwise have been a tale of petty strife and mildly amusing snark takes on deeper import. Wisely, Anshaw keeps the national politics mostly offstage, alluding to them just enough to lend a sense of proportion — not so much counterpoint as compass rose — to the fictional events she maps. In the wee hours of the morning, postelection, Cate comes upon her equally sleepless ex in the kitchen. Anshaw expertly captures the cringe-worthy cadences of a particular strain of liberalism. “The people who voted for him,” Graham frets. “I feel like I should have gone and talked with each of them. Brought charts, scientific articles, photos of melting glaciers, dying polar bears, shown the value of immigrants, how much better it is to consider races and genders equal.” It should be said, the immigrants and races he invokes remain abstractions. Everyone Cate knows seems to be white, except for “a couple of black guys” she once hooked up with while seeking “something different,” and her father’s cook, Juana, whose face “resembles that of a shrunken head” and who speaks “some indigenous language.” Their own insularity prevents no one in this book from totting up the ethical and empathic deficits of others. Cate’s best friend, Neale, disparages Maureen, the woman Cate is dating, for being “totally apolitical. Knows almost nothing about the hideous world we’re living in.” In the rare moment when Cate pauses to consider whether she herself has “gray areas,” she “can’t really come up with any.” Mind you, this is while she’s sneaking around behind Maureen’s back with her former girlfriend, Dana, who is herself being unfaithful to her own partner. “But when she tried to pull back, she found her principles had been shredded by desire. Principles lay in ribbons around her feet.” No kidding. The more we get to know Cate and the people around her, the less principled any of them seem. Or, rather, they seem heavily principled — if principles can be considered a kind of stage makeup. This crowd slathers theirs on like pancake base, an aid to help them portray the characters in which their egos are invested and thus to feel better about themselves, in no small part by allowing them to feel superior to others. One of the problems with constantly making such moral calculations is that it activates our own paranoid defensiveness, disposing us to regard any divergence from our own beliefs as — here’s Freud again — “a criticism of them and a demand for their alteration.” This hamster wheel of thought isn’t progressive but regressive; it’s not about community but divisiveness. It’s a zero-sum game. Into this algorithm Anshaw drops two characters who don’t care a whit about principles. Although Nathan and Irene live close by, they inhabit a realm beneath the purview of Cate and her ilk, a realm of bare mattresses, petty theft, casual rape “and weed and hash and crack and meth.” When they violently assault Neale, Cate responds in a way that’s deemed heroic and is left feeling profoundly altered. Yet any real change is imperceptible. She keeps on lying to Maureen, keeps on trysting with Dana, keeps on fishing for affection from Neale, keeps on resenting others and cheering herself up with mental put-downs. Despite a few slim chapters devoted to depicting their world, we never learn much about Nathan and Irene; what few details we’re given only confirm them as “human garbage.” They remain as unfathomable to us as they do to Cate, who at one point tries to imagine them as complex people. She gets as far as “Maybe they were terribly abused as kids,” before Neale shushes her: “No, no. You need to get off that train of thought. That’s the train that takes you to second thoughts. Rue. You don’t need to muddy up things with rue.” That gesture — the refusal to fathom — hovers like a dark cloud over the entire book. Perhaps this is the point; perhaps Anshaw means to shake us awake from our little narcissisms, our devout solipsisms, our daily applications of principled maquillage. Perhaps, in its curiously bleak way, the novel means to nudge us toward some much-needed muddying. I mightn’t have thought so if not for the last paragraph, which, like a sudden break in the weather, astonishes with the force of its unexpected beauty."

65,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Focused for decades on ending hunger, African countries have largely failed to address a rising obesity epidemic that could soon become the greater public health crisis, experts said as new data was released. A quarter of the world’s 41 million overweight children under five live in Africa, a figure that has nearly doubled on the continent in the last two decades, according to the Global Nutrition Report published on Saturday. There are still six times more children on the continent whose growth is stunted from malnutrition, and that number is also increasing, the report said. But noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, most of which are obesity-related, are expected to become the biggest killer in Africa by 2030, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). “Diets are changing, but they are not becoming more nutritious,” said Corinna Hawkes, co-chair of the Global Nutrition Report. “We’re worried that because attention hasn’t been paid to this issue, obesity has had the space to grow,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. More than 30 percent of adults in Africa are overweight, according to WHO, with obesity rates nearing 10 percent even in very poor countries such as Sierra Leone and Liberia. In some places people are both overweight and malnourished, experts said. Sometimes a mother is obese but her children are stunted, said Hawkes. Highly processed foods have become increasingly affordable and available worldwide, which is one of the primary drivers, said Bruce Lee, executive director of the Global Obesity Prevention Center at Johns Hopkins University. Moreover, in Africa people are often unaware that these foods are unhealthy and do not necessarily see being overweight as a problem, he said. “If you have a country where the concern was always not getting enough food, it’s going to take a while to shift people’s perceptions,” Lee told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. West Africa’s regional health organization (WAHO) makes no mention of weight gain or obesity in all 60 pages of its 2016-2020 strategic plan, although it notes “alarming” rates of diabetes and growing prevalence of high blood pressure. Aid organizations that address hunger should adapt their existing programs to also prevent obesity, said Hawkes. School meal programs in West Africa, for example, are usually focused on making sure children get enough food but sometimes have no standards for quality, she said. Obesity-related conditions are usually expensive to treat and will take a heavy toll on developing countries’ economies, experts say. “If we invest in nutrition, we’ll be helping to achieve other development goals,” said Hawkes. “This is not a side issue.” Reporting By Nellie Peyton; Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.

66,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian Bar Association (OAB) filed a request on Monday to impeach President Dilma Rousseff for obstructing justice, fiscal accounting tricks and granting international soccer body FIFA tax-exempt status during the 2014 World Cup. Rousseff already faces an impeachment process over the alleged manipulation of government accounts that opposition parties maintain helped her win narrow re-election in 2014 by allowing her to boost public spending. Rousseff supporters tried to physically block the entry of the new impeachment request in the lower house of Congress, shouting the left-wing slogan “Não passaram!” (They shall not pass) while pushing and shoving opponents of the embattled president. The most serious impeachable offense in the new request is the alleged interference by the president in investigations into the massive Petrobras corruption scandal. It is based on plea bargain testimony by Senator Delcidio Amaral, a key legislative ally for Rousseff before he was arrested in November. The OAB added the controversial appointment last week to Rousseff’s Cabinet of her predecessor and mentor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, which the lawyers argued was an illegal move to shield him from prosecution in the Petrobras graft probe. Lula’s appointment was suspended pending review by the Supreme Court. The OAB, which represents 1 million lawyers, also listed a complaint that is shared by many Brazilians, that the Rousseff government hurt Brazil’s interests by granting FIFA a generous blanket tax exemption when it held the World Cup in Brazil. The World Cup generated revenues of $4.8 billion for FIFA, against expenses of $2.2 billion, according to FIFA’s website. The new impeachment petition will join a dozen others waiting for consideration by the speaker of the house Eduardo Cunha, a fierce critic of Rousseff who himself is facing corruption charges related to the Petrobras case for allegedly receiving millions in bribes and having undeclared Swiss bank accounts. Cunha can accept a second bid to impeach the president in tandem with the current process but he is only expected to do so if the first case against Rousseff is defeated. Rousseff is struggling to save her presidency in the midst of the worst economic recession in a generation and the widening graft investigation that started at state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro. The odds that the country’s first woman president will be impeached could rise sharply on Tuesday when her largest coalition partner, the PMDB party, is expected to break with her government.

67,"“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” released a fake ""Kavanaugh Beer"" beverage ad to mock Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The 45-second spot begins with Kavanaugh’s comments late last month during the hearing on sexual assault allegations from his days in high school in the 1980s. Kavanaugh admitted that he often drank beer in high school and college. “Yes, we drank beer,” Kavanaugh said during his testimony. “My friends and I, the boys and girls. Yes, we drank beer. I liked beer. I still like beer. We drank beer."" ""We drank beer and I said sometimes — sometimes — probably had too many beers and sometimes other people had too many beers. We drink beer. We liked beer,” he later added. The ""Late Show's"" fake beer ad jabbed Kavanaugh over his comments. “Kavanaugh Beer is full-bodied for great drinkability and supreme judge-ability,” the ad says. “It’s the perfect beer for the judge who doesn’t want to be judged.” The ad says the beer is “no calories” and “no answers.” “Warning: Kavanaugh Beer will give you a hangover that lasts a lifetime appointment,” the ad says. Kavanaugh's drinking habits in high school and college were the subject of various questions by Democrats on the Judiciary Committee during his testimony last month. The nominee clashed with several senators and asked them their own drink preferences while facing questions about allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against him by three women.  Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman to publicly accuse Kavanaugh of sexual assault, testified before the Senate panel hours before Kavanaugh, offering gripping testimony accusing Kavanaugh of drunkenly pinning her to a bed and groping her during a high school party in the summer of 1982 when both were in high school. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations in his subsequent testimony, and denied allegations from two other women who accused him of misconduct stemming from his days in high school and college.

68,"* Dollar gains vs yen, Swiss franc * U.S. unemployment benefits fell last week * ECB frets over euro strength, trade war risk (Recasts, updates rates, adds new comments, changes dateline from LONDON) By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - The dollar was on track to snap a four-day losing streak against a basket of major currencies on Thursday, as worries about the threat of a clash between Western powers and Russia in Syria faded. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.36 percent at 89.886 after four straight days of declines. U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Wednesday of imminent military action in Syria over a suspected poison gas attack. On Thursday, he amended that warning, saying a military strike “could be very soon or not so soon at all.”. The threats had piled pressure on investors already rattled by a trade spat between the United States and China. “It’s a reversal of the safe-haven trade that lifted the yen and the Swiss franc earlier in the week,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. The dollar was up 0.57 percent against the Swiss franc and 0.52 percent higher against the Japanese yen. The Swiss and Japanese currencies are often sought in times of global tension partly because the countries have big current account surpluses. Data on Thursday showed new applications for U.S. unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength. “It dovetails with what we saw in the Fed minutes yesterday, really suggesting that the Fed is on autopilot at this point toward quarterly rate hikes in the year ahead,” said Schamotta. The euro was down 0.46 percent at $1.2308 after minutes from the European Central Bank’s meeting in March showed that policymakers expressed concern over the risk of a full-fledged trade war with the United States and fretted over the potentially harmful impact of the euro’s strength.. Investors were also concerned about a downturn in Purchasing Managers’ Indexes across the euro area, Schamotta said. “It very much looks like the euro area is losing some of the momentum that was carrying the currency higher over the last year and a half,” he said. Euro zone businesses rounded off the first quarter of 2018 with their slowest growth in over a year, as new business took another hit from a stubbornly strong euro, a survey in March showed. To be sure, some market participants view the slowdown as temporary. “In recent weeks, we see pretty good signs of slowing in Europe and Asia. We think this is a soft patch not a sustained downturn. This might last a couple of months,” said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager for OppenheimerFunds’ global multi-asset group, in New York. Sterling edged higher against the dollar as traders prepared for data next week that could help shore up expectations of a May interest rate hike. The pound was up 0.34 percent at $1.4224. Cryptocurrency prices jumped on Thursday, led by a surge in bitcoin to two-week highs, with people active in the market citing a squeeze on traders who have bet against prices. On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin was up 10.7 at $7,683.49. (Additional reporting by Richard Leong Editing by susan Thomas)"
69,"House Minority Leader Nancy PelosiNancy PelosiWhy President Trump needs to speak out on Hong Kong Anti-Trump vets join Steyer group in pressing Democrats to impeach Trump Pelosi warns Mnuchin to stop 'illegal' .3B cut to foreign aid MORE (D-Calif.) staged the closest thing to a filibuster in the chamber on Wednesday as she spoke for more than eight consecutive hours, setting a House record as she demanded a commitment from Republicans to vote on an immigration-reform bill. As Senate leaders unveiled a bipartisan budget deal across the Capitol, Pelosi held the House floor warning that she wouldn’t vote for it without a firmer commitment from Speaker Paul RyanPaul  Davis RyanEmbattled Juul seeks allies in Washington Ex-Parkland students criticize Kellyanne Conway Latina leaders: 'It's a women's world more than anything' MORE (R-Wis.) that the House will consider legislation to protect young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Pelosi, 77, stood in dark blue, four-inch stilettos the whole time as she read aloud stories of individual immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” and argued the merits of allowing them to stay in the country. Pelosi, who began just after 10 a.m., spoke for a total of eight hours and seven minutes, drawing praise after she finished for her ""endurance"" even from a top aide to Ryan. Legit props for the endurance Roughly 50 fellow Democrats were on hand in the House chamber as Pelosi wrapped up. They gave a standing ovation and high-fived her after she concluded her remarks.  The House historian’s office said in a statement that Pelosi’s speech was the longest continuous one it was “able to find on short notice.”   The last known record belonged to then-Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo.) in 1909 at five hours and 15 minutes, the statement read, but he was repeatedly interrupted, unlike Pelosi. Pelosi warned that neither she nor “a large number of members of our caucus"" would support the budget deal without a clearer statement from GOP leaders. “Let the House work its will,” Pelosi said. “Why should the House of Representatives be constrained?” Pelosi's extraordinarily long speech underscored the level of pressure she faces from liberal activists who are urging Democrats to hold firm in negotiations to protect Dreamers. At the same time, Democratic leaders have been working with Republicans to find a way to avoid another government shutdown.

House Democrat calls for gun control: Cities can ban plastic straws but 'we can't ban assault weapons?' MORE (R-Ky.) pledged that he would allow open-ended floor debate on immigration legislation after Feb. 8. But Ryan would not make any similar pledges in the House or guarantee that any bill passed by the Senate would be considered. A spokeswoman for Ryan pointed to past public remarks saying that the House plans to consider immigration legislation. “Speaker Ryan has already repeatedly stated we intend to do a DACA and immigration reform bill — one that the president supports,” AshLee Strong said. Unless enough House Democrats come on board, it’s unclear if the budget deal can pass. Conservatives plan to oppose the budget plan, citing its impact on the deficit. But liberal Democrats have been adamant since late last year that they would use spending bills as leverage to build pressure for an immigration deal. The Trump administration is phasing out the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which granted temporary work permits for qualifying young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The roughly 700,000 recipients are in limbo as lawmakers struggle to reach a deal that would allow them to stay in the country while enhancing border security.

In exchange, Trump has proposed establishing a path to citizenship for nearly two million immigrants, which would go beyond the DACA population. House members cannot stage filibusters in the same way as senators, given that the majority has tight control of the floor in the majoritarian lower chamber. But three members of the House can speak for unlimited amounts of time under chamber rules: the Speaker, majority leader and minority leader. The House didn’t always set limits on floor debate in the way the modern chamber currently does. Lawmakers decided to impose limits on how long they could speak as House membership grew with the westward expansion. The House adopted the first rule in 1841 to limit the time a member could speak in debate on the floor, according to the House historian’s office. Pelosi began speaking as the House debated a bill related to qualified mortgages. That means the House was technically still debating the legislation, even though Pelosi spent her time speaking about immigration. —Updated at 6:28 p.m. View the discussion thread.

70,"Shared Destiny. Shared Responsibility. The Trump Administration’s policy of forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico has effectively eliminated some immigration for now. Story at a glance The new immigration policy aimed at curtailing asylum seekers is proving extremely effective; only 0.1 percent of asylum requests have been granted since September.  The U.S. asylum policy has been dramatically amended this past year; the new Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), colloquially known as Remain in Mexico, instructs asylum seekers with pending immigration court cases to spend the duration of their legal proceedings in Mexico.  Experts say the policy has made it nearly impossible for Central American immigrants to receive asylum in the U.S. These procedures include “metering” or “turnbacks,” further meant to control and deter immigrants from seeking asylum in the U.S.  The San-Diego Union Tribune reported that as of September, out of 47,000 people who applied within the MPP, approximately 9,500 completed their cases. Out of that number, 5,085 cases were issued orders of removal while 4,471 cases were dismissed. This leaves 11 cases being granted asylum, amounting to 0.1 percent of all completed cases.  Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, says part of the reason the numbers are so low is due to the fact that some of the original 47,000 asylum seekers — Reichlin-Melnick estimates there was between 8,000 and 9,000 — have given up their cases, many as a result of rampant crime at the border. “We have no idea who falls into what category. Nobody keeps track of that,” he said in an interview. He added that the government statistics may not be accurate, as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection recently stated it accidentally double counted immigrant data in one report.  Even when an immigrant isn’t denied asylum, cases can take months. An applicant named Bryan described bureaucratic obstacles to attain asylum that lasted more than a year. In the end, the prospect of more time at the border caused him to give up. Reichlin-Melnick thinks that Bryan’s case isn’t accidental, saying that “MPP is about creating obstacles for people to access the legal system.”  “My gut instinct is by the end of the program, of the 47,000 sent back, a year from now less than 2 to 3 percent will have ever won asylum because of the obstacles the program put in place.” All immigrants arriving at the southern border who seek asylum are subjected to the MPP, except for unaccompanied minors, individuals with physical or mental health issues, individuals with a criminal record, citizens or nationals of Mexico, or “individuals determined by an Asylum Officer to be ‘more likely than not’ to face torture or persecution in Mexico on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group,” according to the American Immigration Council. Reichlin-Melnick says that government officials have confirmed that the MPP is intended for Spanish-speaking countries, citing immigrants from Brazil, Cameroon, or India who are not subject to detainment in Mexico — despite the fact that the MPP doesn’t explicitly exclude these populations.  “The so-called MPP has created a humanitarian catastrophe at the border and is undermining the rule of law,” says Reichlin-Melnick.  In defense of the practice, representatives on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security state that the Remain in Mexico policy is deterring immigrants from filing false asylum claims, which allows legitimate claims to be processed.

72,"The state-run psychiatric hospital here in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, has long been a forgotten place, filled with forgotten people. But with Venezuela suffering from a severe economic crisis, this mental institution has almost no drugs to control the afflictions tormenting its patients. At the invitation of doctors, reporters from The New York Times visited six psychiatric wards across the country. All reported shortages of medicine, even food. The one here, El Pampero Hospital, hasn’t employed a psychiatrist in two years. It has running water for only a few hours a day, and food is scarce. Omar Mendoza, pictured above, is one of many undernourished patients. He lost half his weight this summer and is down to about 75 pounds. The glue that keeps this hospital in order — the sedatives, tranquilizers and medications — is nearly all gone. In courtyards, women who are functional while medicated are now curled on the floor hallucinating, crying, screaming, rocking back and forth for hours. The doctors and nurses here are aghast at what is taking place, caught between anger and feelings of helplessness. The nursing staff debates daily: Who gets the few remaining pills? Who is the most unstable, or suffering the most? They reduce doses, doling out pills into small metal cups with the fluidity of Las Vegas casino dealers. El Pampero also suffers from shortages of basic personal-care and cleaning supplies. There is no soap, no shampoo, no toothpaste, no toilet paper. Patients relieve themselves in the common areas and patio area, and clean themselves only with water. Nurses fear that patients in the men’s ward are more likely to become violent when they are unmedicated. Two of the men in this photograph murdered members of their families before their schizophrenia was diagnosed. One decapitated his mother, and the other stabbed his stepfather. We found Cleofila Carillo crying softly under a mosquito net. The morning before, her unmedicated bunkmate had leapt on top of her, beaten her, bitten off her nose and eaten it. Doctors said she needed full reconstructive surgery, but because of the shortages, they did not have the medical supplies to perform it. All they could do was apply a bandage. Without sedatives, nurses say, they must restrain patients or lock them in isolation cells to keep them from harming themselves. That is what happened to Raul Martínez, who was suffering a psychotic episode. A nurse tied him to a gurney. Patients eat three times a day, but there is never enough food from the government. Members of the hospital staff solicit donations during their time off. Medical records show that over half of the patients in the men’s ward are underweight. Clothes are also in short supply at the hospital. Many patients in the women’s ward wear only T-shirts, and few have shoes. The clothing they do have is ill fitting and threadbare. Nurses fashion belts out of surgical gloves and pieces of rope to keep patients’ pants from sliding off their slight frames. Down the hall, Ms. Carillo’s attacker had been isolated and locked inside a small solitary confinement cell. She yelled at nurses when they asked why she had bitten off and swallowed her roommate’s nose. “It wasn’t me, I did not do it,” she repeated, claiming that she did not know what they were talking about. When Yusmar Torres had no medication to control her mood disorder and depression, she constructed a noose out of a bedsheet and threatened to commit suicide. The staff stripped her of her clothes for safety and put her in a solitary confinement cell, where she was left for days. There are few light moments in El Pampero, but every Friday morning, therapists put on salsa music and hold a dance for the 10 percent of patients who are stable enough to participate. Before the medicine shortages, the recreation center held weekly sewing, cooking and sculpture classes, even a farming program. One therapist said: “When patients have their medicines, they can do really complex crafts. Now they just do simple tasks.” Mr. Martínez, who suffers from schizophrenia but has little medication, took a nap under his bed. He also suffers from depression. The head nurse, Evila García, fed a blind patient as a stray cat roamed the women’s ward dining hall. Several stray dogs and cats live in the hospital, and the dogs often sleep with patients in their beds. Nurses worry about parasites because the animals have not had their shots and have not been dewormed, but some patients find comfort in them. The Venezuelan government denies that its public hospitals are suffering from shortages, and has refused multiple offers of international medical aid. Josefina Zapata, a patient suffering from psychosis and epilepsy, was in solitary confinement. She was not violent, but the hospital staff did not have the anticonvulsants she needed. The staff regularly kept her locked in this cell, on a mattress on the floor, so that when she started convulsing, she was less likely to hurt herself. The vast majority of patients living at El Pampero have been abandoned by their families and rely completely on the state to meet their basic needs. “May God have mercy on us,” the head nurse said. video"
73,Dec 2 (Reuters) - China Jicheng Holdings Ltd : * Chen jieyou resigned as an executive director Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:
74,"‘The strength of this team is we have a lot of strengths,’ says a midfielder who has emerged as one of the most important ones. REIMS, France — United States midfielder Rose Lavelle shimmied a bit in her seat and jokingly cupped her hand to her ear as she sat beside her coach, Jill Ellis, at a news conference in advance of Monday’s knockout round game against Spain. Ellis had just been asked to describe what Lavelle brings to the team. “She’s a joy,” Ellis said, as the superlatives flowed. “The way she approaches the game, how she plays on the field, who she is off the field.” On a United States team with 11 World Cup rookies, Lavelle, 24, is arguably the most creative young playmaker. Her talent was on full display when she produced one of the best games of her career in a 2-0 victory against Sweden on Thursday. Even though Lavelle flummoxed Sweden with her whimsical play and sneaky speed, Ellis replaced her in the 63rd minute with Christen Press. The move, Ellis said, was more about the Americans’ abundant skill and depth than Lavelle’s play or fitness. Throughout the United States’ first three games of the World Cup, Ellis has assembled her lineups as one might cook a pot of bouillabaisse: no matter what ingredient she added, the result was the same. After playing everyone on the roster except her backup goalkeepers in the group stage, and starting only three players in all three games, the Americans scored a record 18 goals in three shutouts. “I think honestly the strength of this team is we have a lot of strengths,” Lavelle said. “We’re really deep and we don’t rely on one person to get the job done. That gives us confidence moving forward, knowing that anyone can step up, have a big play and help us win the game.” Having such mix-and-match versatility will help the Americans in the round of 16 after only three days rest. Spain has had a six-day layoff. Should the top-ranked Americans beat No. 13 Spain, a quarterfinal match with France would await. Also, given a heat wave is about to hit France with temperatures expected to be around 100 this week, depth may be critical. The Americans say they will be full strength against Spain: Ellis declared midfielder Julie Ertz, who missed the Sweden game with a minor hip problem, and forward Alex Morgan, who left it early after absorbing a hard foul late in the first half, as “fine.” Ellis’s tinkering with different combinations has been purposeful, given the quick turnarounds. Lavelle made her World Cup debut with two goals and an assist in her team’s opening game, a 13-0 thrashing of Thailand, then sat out against Chile, a 3-0 victory, as Ellis rested seven starters. She returned against Sweden, and helped the United States press their attacks from the opening minute. “You can see what she is capable of doing in terms of the final pass, in terms of being dangerous with the shot, the pass, the separation she can create,” Ellis said. “She’s one of the best players in the air ...” As Ellis continued, Lavelle contorted her face, disagreeing with her coach about her ability in the air. “You are, Rose,” Ellis continued. “Your timing is really good and we have some beasties in the air, but you get up there.” Despite Lavelle’s current status, her spot on the World Cup roster wasn’t always assured, given her struggles with a series of hamstring injuries. Two years ago, she made her first national team appearance, scored her first international goal and after a standout career at Wisconsin became the first pick in the National Women’s Soccer League draft. But an injury cut her rookie season short. “They always had this belief in me that I was going to come back and be the same player I was before I got hurt,” Lavelle said about the national team’s coaches. “Knowing that I had their confidence helped me get back to that point.” In addition to her increasingly sturdy and incisive midfield play, she also brings to the team an endearing sense of silly: see her choreographed hip-hop dances with teammates; feel her anxiety as takes on life’s big questions (how best to ask the stranger in the aisle seat when she needs to use the restroom?); and follow the weight loss saga and sartorial choices of her bulldog, Wilma Jean Wrinkles, a regular on her social media accounts. Wilma Jean is missing the World Cup — Lavelle said last week that she had installed an app on her phone that allows her to deliver treats to Wilma Jean on command — but here in France, life is good. In a country where dogs do everything with their humans, short of taking long drags on cigarettes, Lavelle is in pooch heaven. “There are so many great dogs here,” she said. “Unfortunately, I don’t know how to say, ‘Can I pet your dog?’ in French, but if the dog and their human look friendly, I’ll do it anyway.”"

77,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Thursday rejected a deal brokered between Ecuador and the United Kingdom that would allow him to leave the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for the first time in six years, the U.K.’s Telegraph reported. Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno said Assange can choose to leave the embassy without the risk of being extradited for charges abroad. ""The way has been cleared for Mr. Assange to take the decision to leave in near-liberty,"" Moreno told The Telegraph, without elaborating on what “near-liberty” meant. Assange's lawyer, Barry Pollack, told The Telegraph that the U.K.-Ecuador agreement was not acceptable because it did not protect Assange from being extradited to the United States. Assange has been under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) since 2010 after WikiLeaks leaked thousands of classified reports on the war in Afghanistan stolen by the former U.S. Army Intelligence analyst now known as Chelsea Manning.  WikiLeaks also posted thousands of emails stolen from Democrats by Russian agents during the 2016 presidential election, which has been a focus of special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) Swan MuellerMueller report fades from political conversation Trump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony MORE’s probe into possible links between Trump campaign associates and Russia.  The DOJ last month inadvertently revealed in a court filing that they have prepared charges against Assange.  The charges appear to be tied to Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election but it is unclear what the charges are.  Assange reportedly fears being convicted in the U.S. and facing prison time. ""The suggestion that as long as the death penalty is off the table, Mr. Assange need not fear persecution is obviously wrong,"" Pollack told the outlet. ""No one should have to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information.” Pollack added that since it appears that the U.S. has brought charges against Assange, Ecuador should continue providing him asylum. Assange fled to the embassy in 2012 when British courts ordered he be extradited to Sweden to be questioned in a sexual assault case, which has since been dropped. He still faces charges in the U.K. for skipping bail. He has accused the Ecuadorean government of trying to end his asylum because of new rules the embassy has imposed on him.  The set of new rules require Assange to do a variety of things including pay for medical bills and phone calls, stay away from commenting on controversial topics and clean up after his pet cat.

78,"(Updates to close) Feb 2 (Reuters) - Australian shares eased slightly on Thursday, led by real estate stocks, as the Australian dollar rallied on data that showed a record trade surplus last month. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell 7.76 points, or 0.14 percent, to 5,645.4 at the close of trade. The Australian dollar surged 0.7 percent to $0.7639, after the country reported a larger-than-expected trade surplus thanks to surging commodity prices. Investors typically look to book profits when the Aussie rises against the U.S. dollar, an analyst said. Real estate stocks were a main driver behind the market’s decline. Shopping centres operator Scentre Group fell 1.13 percent, while property company Stockland Corporation Ltd slipped 1.37 percent. Three of the ‘Big 4’ banks slipped and Westpac Banking Corp was flat. Qantas Airways Ltd eased 1.2 percent, while rival Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd closed 2.3 percent weaker. The losses offset gains in the commodities industry, which usually finds support from a declining U.S. dollar. Rio Tinto Ltd climbed 0.22 percent, major gold producer Newcrest Mining Ltd rose 2.17 percent, and South32 Ltd ended 0.7 percent higher. OceanaGold Corp, however, shed 17.8 percent after the Philippine mining minister ordered the suspension of some of its mines, citing environmental destruction. The materials index rose 0.2 percent, while the metals index rose 0.43 percent. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.03 percent, or 1.96 points, to finish the session at 7,053.54. A 1.8 percent drop in shares of building materials supplier Fletcher Building Ltd drove losses in the materials sector, which fell 0.16 percent. Utilities further shaved off 0.10 percent, led by Meridian Energy Ltd. (Reporting by Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Randy Fabi)"
79,"A legal challenge slowly winding its way through courts in Idaho, West Virginia and Wisconsin aims to have right-to-work laws declared unconstitutional. Organized labor hopes a more liberal Supreme Court will toss out over 70 years of precedent for the significant number of American workers who don’t want to be involved with a union. Fortunately, there is a solution that should turn the current court cases, never mind the potential Supreme Court challenges, into a moot point. Called “Worker’s Choice,” it would make unionized workplaces into much more free and fair environments. Unions are challenging right-to-work laws under the takings clauses of state constitutions and the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which says that private property cannot “be taken for public use, without just compensation.” Unions are arguing that right-to-work laws amount to a taking because, while employees in right-to-work states are not obliged to support a union, these “free riders” are still, by law, represented by unions. Unions’ complaint here rings more than a bit hollow, given that unions themselves have lobbied to keep the current all-or-nothing situation in place. These so-called free riders are really “forced riders,” many of whom would like to represent themselves, but can’t. Even in right-to-work states where unions cannot get workers fired for not paying them, workers must still accept union representation whether they want it or not. The unions’ proposed solution to the free/forced rider problem is to compel every worker to be represented by and pay money to a union. In their ideal world, workers would pay up and largely let someone else speak for them. But this solution ignores a more commonsense approach that even most union members support. According to a Google online survey of rank-and-file union members across the country—including those who are happy with their union--almost 70 percent believe that employees should represent themselves with their employer if they decide to opt out of paying dues. The poll (sponsored by the National Employee Freedom Week campaign which runs August 14th to 20th) was not geared toward anti-union or independent workers. The same union members were also asked if they would leave their union if they could do so without penalty. More than one-quarter, or 28.7 percent, said they would use the right to exit. In short, even though two-thirds of those surveyed said they would stay in the union, a large majority supported giving full freedom to those that wanted out of the union contract. A less generous interpretation would be that they didn’t want to pay for workers who wanted nothing to do with them. Congress and state legislatures could recognize this reality by giving all parties what they claim to want. Congress could change federal law to give this right to private sector employees while states could do the same for public. Let unions represent only those workers who are willing to be represented by unions, which frees them of the expense of representing everyone else. At the same time, let those workers who don’t want to be represented by unions handle their own negotiations over compensation and workplace rights. Being able to bargain directly with their employer will allow these workers to get out of a one-size-fits-all contract and negotiate for wages and working conditions tailored to their individual needs. The seniority system most union contracts mandate only allows workers to receive a raise by logging another year on the job. But if a worker wants to be rewarded for how hard she works, she could use Worker’s Choice to negotiate for merit pay. For employers, Worker’s Choice does not create any increased burdens. It still maintains the status quo where only one union represents all unionized workers at the worksite. Further, it treats former union members the same as the 87 percent of workers in the economy who are not represented by a union. This means the employer doesn’t have the same obligations to these workers, such a being forced to bargain, as they do with unions. Union leaders may not like Worker’s Choice approach initially but it is by no means clear they would lose a great deal from it. A chief selling point of organized labor is that union representatives are good at negotiating the best possible deal for workers. If they can deliver on this promise, non-union employees won’t be non-union for long — and those who are in the union will have little incentive to opt out. However, workers shouldn't be forced to pay for a service they do not want simply to keep their jobs. F. Vincent Vernuccio is the director of labor policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy.

81,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Demand for loans weakened among U.S. businesses and households in the last three months of 2018 while banks tightened lending standards for commercial real estate, according to a survey of bank officers that gave worrisome signs for the economic outlook. The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday released its quarterly survey of senior loan officers. The survey also showed banks had kept standards for commercial and industrial lending “basically unchanged” in the quarter but had tightened standards for credit card borrowing. In a foreboding assessment, banks said they expected in 2019 “to tighten standards for all categories of business loans as well as credit card loans and jumbo mortgages,” according to the quarterly report from the Fed. Credit is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy and reports of weaker demand - coupled with expectations at banks that standards will tighten - suggests U.S. lenders are seeing signs that economic growth could slow. Fed policymakers last month indicated they were pausing a rate increase campaign that began in December 2015 as the U.S. central bank tries to sort out how much a weakening global economy could drag on the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2018, U.S. “banks reported weaker demand for all categories of loans to households,” the Fed said, an assessment that suggested U.S. consumers could also be worried about the economic outlook.

83,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The deep-sea search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 ended on Tuesday without any trace being found of the plane that vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board, the three countries involved in the search said. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. “Despite every effort using the best science available ... the search has not been able to locate the aircraft,” Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. “The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.” The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 120,000-sq-km (46,000-sq-mile) area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the $145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators’ recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked - or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. “In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been “thorough and comprehensive” and it “stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search”. “MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located,” it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. “If money is a concern, prioritise within this area,” Nathan said. In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended “purely due to a funding shortage”. “The 370 incident is the most important thing in my life,” he said, referring to the flight number. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American.

84,"Portrait mode-style bokeh camera features have largely been the realm of high-end flagships to this point. That’s due, in part to the fact that many device makers rely on a dual-camera system to create the effect, driving up prices in the process. Samsung is getting ready to change that soon, however, with a plan to bring its version of the tech to mid-range and entry-level handsets. The company’s not talking specifics here, with regard to which models will actually be getting the technology or when. Of course, it seems like a no-brainer that Samsung’s own many mid-level devices get first dibs, but the company is well positioned as a component maker for so many different manufactures, I’d anticipate the feature will be arriving on third-party phones, as well. Of course, Sony still holds the top spot for camera image sensors, in spite of having less success with its own phones, but Samsung’s got a pretty decent chunk of the market, as well. The company’s implementation of the technology is one of the more compelling among flagships. Introduced with the Galaxy Note 8, the tech offers a more customizable depth-of-field effect than many competitors. Since the deal involves both its proprietary image sensors and software algorithms, that likely means that the full package will be arriving on any devices that choose to implement it.

86,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will remove child refugees from its remote Pacific detention centers within weeks, a senior diplomat said, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison seeks to secure support for his government, which looks set to become a minority administration. Canberra’s hard-line immigration policy sees asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia sent for processing to camps in Papua New Guinea and on the South Pacific island of Nauru. While aid agencies have called for the removal of the more than 1,000 refugees held for more than five years, Morrison is under immense pressure to resettle 40 children currently held on Nauru amid warnings they are suffering from declining mental health. Detailing the first public timetable for the removal of the children, George Brandis, Australia’s High Commissioner to Britain, said Canberra will remove the children, though he did specify where they would be moved to. “There are hardly any children in Nauru and in New Guinea, and we expect that by the end of this year there’ll be none,” Brandis told British radio station LBC on Tuesday. By resettling the child refugees, Morrison will meet a key demand from several independent lawmakers for supporting for his government. Morrison’s ruling Liberal Party is on course to lose its one-seat parliamentary majority as voters in a Sydney electorate look set to select an independent lawmaker to replace former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. Counting in the by-election continues, with independent Kerryn Phelps ahead of the Liberal Party candidate by nearly 1,800 votes, with just 2,000 ballots to be processed, the Australian Electoral Commission said Turnbull quit politics shortly after he was removed from the office of prime minister in August following a party revolt that installed Morrison as leader. The loss of Turnbull’s affluent Sydney constituency would leave Morrison’s government dependent on the support of five independent lawmakers to pass legislation in the lower house of parliament. Several independent lawmakers have said they may back no confidence motions that would trigger an early election unless the children held on Nauru were removed.

89,"What's in a name? If it's smart beta, just about everything in the new investment product landscape. Smart beta is the new face of active investment management, with new funds coming to market on a regular basis. Much of the billions of dollars flowing out of actively managed mutual funds is flowing into so-called smart beta funds. While definitions of these funds abound, as the name implies, they aim to beat the market (beta), either with better performance or better management of risks. They try to do that by tracking an index weighted according to factors other than market capitalization, such as dividend-paying policies, fundamental strength, value, momentum or low volatility. In other words, they try to do what active managers do, but in a rules-based, transparent and inexpensive way. Since the financial crisis, the demand for these funds has exploded. Research firm Morningstar was monitoring 708 such funds, with $740 billion in assets, at the end of January. That compares to 213 funds managing $133 billion in 2009. ""Investors are using these funds as a replacement for active strategies,"" said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar. While smart beta is the commonly used label for these funds, Morningstar prefers the term strategic beta. ""Not all these strategies are smart,"" said Bryan. ""Sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't."" He added, ""People need to evaluate them like they do active managers."" Rob Arnott, founder of Research Affiliates and widely credited with pioneering the concept of smart beta investing, thinks the term no longer has meaning. ""It's been stretched to encompass just about everything formulaic, with the result that a lot of dumb ideas are being called smart beta,"" he said. ""It now spans just about everything, so the term effectively means nothing."" Vanguard, the market leader in low-cost index funds, has avoided the term smart beta entirely in its recent product offerings in the space. In mid-February the firm launched six new factor-based ETFs and one new factor-based mutual fund. The funds target exposure to the factors of value, momentum, quality, low volatility and liquidity. A multifactor fund will combine the factors of momentum, fundamentals strength and value (low price to fundamentals). ""We think we've hit the biggest, most robust factors that investors can use predictively,"" said John Ameriks, head of Vanguard's Quantitative Equity Group, which will manage the funds. Always skeptical of investment product proliferation, it plans to stick with this lineup. ""If there is demand for a broader set of [factor funds], we'll consider it, but we have no plans to enhance this suite,"" Ameriks said. Vanguard took its time coming to market with its funds, in part because it didn't apply for exemptive relief with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an index fund, as many smart beta offerings do. ""This is actively managed investing, and people need to think of it like that,"" said Ameriks. ""Investors need to understand the strategies the same way they analyze active managers."" Vanguard also wanted to provide context for investors by simultaneously launching a website with educational material on how to use the funds to achieve financial goals. As always, Vanguard is throwing the gauntlet down to the rest of the industry in terms of cost. The single-factor funds carry an expense fee of 13 basis points — a fraction of the cost of most smart beta funds. The fee on the multifactor fund is 18 points. ""Active returns have always come from emphasizing factors,"" Ameriks said. ""These funds enable people to get them at a much lower cost."" Smart beta offerings will keep coming to market, and choosing among them will only get harder. Most of the existing funds have no meaningful track record. The fund marketers happily provide backtested results for the strategies the funds pursue, but investors need to be wary. ""We encourage people not to put a lot of faith in back-tested results,"" said Bryan at Morningstar. ""Companies can tweak their models to get the results they want."" Bryan nevertheless expects the market for these funds to continue growing rapidly. The fund companies like them because they can charge a higher fee than simple index funds. Investors like them because they are less expensive than actively managed mutual funds yet still provide the opportunity to beat the market. ""Investors still want to do better than average,"" said Bryan. ""If these funds deliver, the flows will follow."" Therein lies a potential pitfall for investors. It's a boilerplate disclaimer, but past performance is not indicative of future results. In fact, it's very often the opposite, as outperforming strategies tend to revert to mean over the long run. ""Every factor except value is currently trading at a premium to market,"" said Arnott at Research Affiliates. He argues that momentum investing, the best performing factor last year in a surging market, has added no value for investors over a 10-year period thanks to the momentum crash of 2008-09. Investors looking to jump into the hottest strategies could be setting themselves up for disappointment. Arnott suggested investors have to take a high-level value perspective on factor investing strategies that they're considering. ""Any time trillions of dollars is being invested in the same strategies, they won't work for long,"" he said. ""Buying what has performed well in the past almost guarantees poor performance."" — By Andrew Osterland, special to CNBC.com"
90,"Washington (CNN)Susan Pompeo, wife of Central Intelligence Agency chief Mike Pompeo, has taken on an unusually active role for a CIA spouse in agency affairs since he started the job in January 2017, regularly spending her days at the agency, traveling with her husband, and attending agency social events -- seven sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The Washington Post was first to publish a story detailing concerns over Pompeo's role, CNN has been reporting on the story for a number of weeks. Susan Pompeo is the ""Honorary Chair"" of the Family Advisory Board, according Ryan Trapani, a CIA spokesman. The board serves as a liaison between the agencies and families, whose members serve a two-year term and provide families with access to educational resources. She often attends or hosts events ""in support of the agency,"" Trapani said. While Pompeo does not technically have her own office, she frequents the seventh floor director's suite at CIA's campus in Langley, Virginia, where CIA employees often ""assist Mrs. Pompeo in various ways,"" said Trapani. This includes preparing ""materials, briefings, meeting agendas and so forth for our programs assisting spouses traveling overseas."" She also works on projects for the Family Advisory Board, as well as providing support services to relocate CIA officers around the world. The CIA says none of these officers are officially assigned to work for Pompeo, and do not spend all their time with her, her work has led sources familiar with the matter to believe that they were her employees, and that she'd adopted a permanent residence upstairs in Langley. It is not clear whether Susan Pompeo has been officially hired in a special role in the agency, but Trapani says she is not paid and does not control any agency funds. ""Mrs. Pompeo's work on behalf of CIA officers and their families has been broadly praised and welcomed, particularly by officers stationed in the field. She has graciously volunteered her time, much like former director's spouses, to drive initiatives that specifically make the lives of CIA officers and their families better for nothing more than the proud satisfaction of helping the Agency achieve its mission,"" Trapani said. A congressional source told CNN that Pompeo's role has ""definitely raised eyebrows ... particularly the use of the office space. CIA explained that away by saying there's an empty space she uses which is exactly what I'd say if she had an office.""   Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at the Washington University in St. Louis, called Susan Pompeo's role at the CIA a ""red flag,"" questioning her use of CIA office space and the assistance she has received from CIA officials. ""If staff are helping her, it sounds like she can direct staff. It's odd that someone who is not a government official or an employee is allowed to direct actual government employees,"" Clark said. Pompeo's gatekeeper role While she has a secret level clearance, which does not afford her access to most sensitive information, sources familiar argued that she keeps a closer eye on her husband's highly sensitive calendar than previous spouses -- modulating the flow of guests in and out. The CIA argued that Pompeo's role in her husband's schedule was limited to coordinating personal and family matters, but her presence, one source described as like a ""gatekeeper,"" has made others uncomfortable. Trapani pushed back strongly against what he called ""false and disgusting rumors being peddled about Director Pompeo, his wife, and their family are nothing more than a disgraceful attempt to politicize his nomination for Secretary of State without regard for the truth."" Pompeo played an active role in her husband's political rise, advising him on his four congressional campaigns and serving as one of his most-trusted advisers. Beyond joining her husband at campaign rallies and appearing in at least one ad touting her husband's candidacy, she played an even bigger role behind the scenes advising her husband on the direction of the campaign. Former Pompeo campaign aides recalled receiving emails from both the candidate and spouse -- sometimes within minutes of each other -- offering similar thoughts on next moves the campaign should make. That's because the couple would often stay up late in the rush of the campaign, brainstorming from a home office they shared. At CIA, not much has changed. ""She was very much treating it like Pompeo was still in Congress,"" one source familiar with Susan Pompeo's current role said. Mieke Eoyang, a former staffer for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN that spouses typically don't have access to much sensitive information ""or knowledge of exactly what's on the director's calendar."" She said that sort of behavior is more normal for congressional offices -- a role Pompeo used to occupy. She said there is certainly a ""social role"" for the spouse ""especially in a community like this"" but the lines can get blurry.  ""There's a real question about her influence,"" she continued. ""This isn't a family business, it's national security,"" she said. The Pompeos have also visited residences at Camp Peary, Virginia, the CIA's remote training facility known as ""The Farm,"" a visit that caused some internal frustration, four sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN. Trapani did not confirm or deny the travel to Camp Peary but referenced a Christmas trip to an agency building. ""Director Pompeo and has family stayed at an Agency-owned facility for three days over Christmas 2017,"" wrote Trapani. ""In an effort to reduce the CIA security and support footprint required for them over the holidays, the Pompeos did not travel to visit their families which would have required a significant number of our officers to be away from their families. This trip was taken after review by career agency attorneys, and where appropriate, the Pompeo's reimbursed the expenses, including lodging."" The couple's son, Nicholas, a 27-year-old working at a tech startup in New York, has also recreationally used a CIA gun range at Camp Peary on at least one occasion, three sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN.  One former senior CIA official told CNN that ""you're not even supposed to be there without a clearance ... it's absolutely outrageous."" But Trapani told CNN that non-CIA personnel are allowed to use these types of facilities. ""Career Agency attorneys, as a standard practice, review and approve travel whenever the Director's family travels with him. Where appropriate, the government is reimbursed,"" Trapani said.  Role of previous spouses  At the CIA, being the spouse of an agency employee -- from an overseas operator or an analyst to a high-ranking official -- can be grueling and thankless. ""We lied about our husband's jobs, stalled inquisitive policemen, befriended minister's wives, kept our ears open at parties, deflected the children's questions, and worried in silence alone,"" Bina Cady Kiyonaga, the wife of an East Asia and Latin America operations officer, wrote in her memoir in 2000. CIA director's wives have played varying roles, depending on their willingness and availability to work alongside their spouses. Stephanie Glakas-Tenet, CIA Director George Tenet's wife, Jeanine Hayden, CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden's wife, and Mary Beth Morrell, former acting director Mike Morrell's wife, for example, jumped into the role and made deep and sincere efforts to provide support to agency families. Glakas-Tenet compiled a cookbook of recipes and stories from CIA families around the world and Hayden picked up her work, publishing a sequel. Those outreach efforts, particularly for military spouses, were largely well-received at the agency. At Gen. Hayden's urging, Jeanine Hayden stepped up when her husband became CIA director, serving as an emissary to families, helping them find and utilize agency resources such as psychiatric counseling and education. Larry Pfeiffer, Gen. Michael Hayden's former chief of staff at the CIA, said Jeanine Hayden was granted a secret level clearance simply to be in the building and interact with families, but not for access to any real sensitive or secret information. She was also officially hired by the agency in a ""no compensation"" position. ""We were absolutely meticulous about that,"" Pfeiffer said. In his book ""The Great War of Our Time: The CIA's Fight Against Terrorism -- From al Qa'ida to ISIS,"" Mike Morrell writes that his wife Mary Beth ""had her own CIA pass and could normally drive onto the compound and come into the headquarters building without an escort.""  However, there were times when sensitive activity was occurring and she was stopped at the driveway, excluded because she did not have a ""need to know."" He also writes about how she was very involved in the agency towards the end of his tenure and got involved in efforts to ""support the families of our officers.""  She was later given an award for her service. CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report."
91,"Derrius Guice rushed for two touchdowns and the Washington Redskins came up with a late goal-line stand in a 29-21 victory against the host Carolina Panthers on Sunday afternoon in Charlotte, N.C. The Redskins (3-9) won for the second week in a row and they didn’t allow a point for a 48-minute stretch until the game’s final two minutes. Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen scrambled 17 yards for a touchdown with 1:51 remaining on a drive extended because of a fourth-down conversion. Carolina recovered the ensuing onside kick and reached the Washington 1 for a first down before running back Christian McCaffrey lost yards on consecutive plays, followed by an incomplete pass and a sack. Guice gained 129 yards on 10 carries. Teammate Adrian Peterson picked up 99 rushing yards on 13 attempts, including a 12-yard touchdown run with 4:26 to play. Redskins quarterback Dwayne Haskins was 13-for-25 for 147 yards. Allen was 27 of 46 for 278 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. The Panthers (5-7) have a four-game losing streak. Carolina built a 14-0 lead less than 10 minutes into the game. The Panthers scored on the opening drive, with Allen throwing 4 yards to Curtis Samuel. Allen threw 13 yards to wide-open DJ Moore for another touchdown. Washington’s Dustin Hopkins kicked first-half field goals from 25 and 42 yards as the Redskins trailed 14-12 at the half. His 36-yarder in the third quarter gave Washington a 15-14 lead. That was the score in the fourth quarter when the Redskins went 67 yards in seven plays to stretch the lead. Guice ran 37 yards to the 1 before diving in for the score on the next play with 9:09 remaining. Guice’s 1-yard TD run in the second quarter was set up by cornerback Fabian Moreau’s interception and 10-yard return to the Carolina 1-yard line to make it 14-12. The Redskins tried to tie the game, but an apparent completed two-point conversion pass was overturned on video review. Panthers tight end Greg Olsen was helped off the field after a vicious hit to the head by Washington linebacker Ryan Anderson with 4:25 remaining in the third quarter. Olsen was placed in concussion protocol, while Anderson was disqualified from the remainder of the game for the helmet-to-helmet contact. —Field Level Media "
92,".@SteveScalise: The A.T.F. should review their decision to authorize bump stocks, rather than Congress. Full interview airs Sunday on #MTP. pic.twitter.com/p0E4Fd1OcY House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) says it's ""a little bit early"" for Congress to act to ban bump stocks after they were used by the Las Vegas shooter who killed more than 50 people and wounded hundreds more, arguing that most Americans are still learning the facts. In an excerpt from an upcoming interview with ""Meet The Press,"" Scalise tells host Chuck Todd that until the shooting happened, he and many other Americans had never heard of a bump stock, a device that allows some semi-automatic weapons to fire more rapidly, acting like automatic fire. ""If you talk to anybody about a week ago, most people including myself didn't know what a bump stock was, now we're finding out about it,"" says Scalise, who is still recovering from a gunshot wound he received over the summer. The powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) on Thursday called for additional regulations on bump stocks, breaking its silence after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.  Multiple Republican lawmakers have also signaled a willingness to act on the firearm accessory. Scalise accused House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats of wanting to make a ""slippery slope"" that enables an erosion of gun rights in America. ""There are people who want to rush to judgement, they've already got a bill written,"" Scalise said. ""Look, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi already said she wants it to be a slippery slope. She doesn't want to stop at bump stocks. They want to go out and limit the rights of gun owners."" ""So I do think it's a little bit early for people to say they know what to do to fix this problem,"" he continued. ""I know there are people asking the ATF to go back and review their 2010 decision to authorize it, and I think they should."" Scalise, who was injured in a shooting targeting Republican lawmakers at a baseball practice on June 14, made his return to Congress last week after months of hospitalization and surgeries. In a statement, Scalise's office said he will be resuming his work on Capitol Hill while he completes an ""extended period"" of out-patient rehabilitation over the coming months. Scalise said earlier this week that, far from making him more open to gun control, the incident has ""fortified"" his belief in the Second Amendment. View the discussion thread.

93,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Linde (LIN.N) (LINI.DE), the world’s biggest industrial gases group, has taken a 10% stake in Hydrospider AG, a Swiss producer and supplier of hydrogen derived from renewable energy sources, Hydrospider said on Thursday. Hydrospider is currently building a plant to turn electricity from a hydroelectric station run by Swiss utility Alpiq (ALPH.S) into hydrogen for trucks to be built by a joint venture of Hyundai Motors (005380.KS) and Swiss group H2 Energy. Alpiq and H2 Energy each own 45% in Hydrospider, whose site will start commercial operations by the end of the year. “The participation offers Linde the opportunity to actively shape one of the most attractive endeavors for green hydrogen and emission-free mobility in Europe,” Jens Waldeck, head of central Europe at Linde’s Gases division, said in a statement. The hydrogen to be produced by Hydrospider will power the first 50 of a total 1,600 trucks Hyundai and H2 Energy plan to bring to Swiss roads by 2025. The move comes amid ongoing efforts by some carmakers, including Hyundai, Toyota 7293.T, Honda Motor (7267.T) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE) to promote hydrogen fuel cells, which have been hampered by the technology’s high price and lack of refueling infrastructure. Toyota, which views hydrogen fuel cells as the preferred alternative to electric vehicle batteries, last month said it would supply hydrogen fuel cell parts to Chinese rivals FAW [SASACJ.UL] and Higer Bus. Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) on Thursday confirmed that as a large volume manufacturer it was banking on battery-powered electric cars, adding fuel-cells would only be used in niche areas like trucks and buses and over long distances.

94," (CNN)Some sun protection may come at a steep price for the ocean's coral reefs. Now, a Florida state senator wants to ban some sunscreens entirely for the potential harm they cause marine life. Sen. Linda Stewart's proposed bill would require a prescription to use sunscreens with oxybenzone and octinoxate, two chemicals found in most sunscreens that effectively protect against UV radiation but, researchers suggest, can also cause coral bleaching and eventually kill reefs.  Under the bill, their sale would be banned without a prescription.""Reef-safe"" sunscreens that leave out those ingredients in lieu of others, like FDA-approved zinc oxide, would take their place on store shelves.  Stewart told CNN she modeled her bill after similar ones passed in Key West and Hawaii. Those banned the sale of all sunscreens with the two chemicals to protect nearby reefs, essential to the islands' tourism economy and marine biodiversity. The measures won't go into effect until January 2021.  Reefs are important If reefs continue to die, global coastlines would take a serious hit.  Coral reefs are natural protection for coastlines, absorbing 97% of a wave's energy to prevent erosion and potential property damage incurred from currents and storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  They're also home to 25% of all marine life, serving as tropical rainforests that protect the ocean's biodiversity.  But they're under constant attack, and chemicals in sunscreen are hardly corals' only foe. Climbing ocean temperatures and pollution have killed nearly 30% of the world's reefs, causing heat stress and mass bleaching events, according to NOAA.  For best sun protection practices, NOAA recommends opting for ""reef-safe"" sunscreens and, better yet, covering up. Staying under an umbrella, wearing UV sunglasses and long-sleeve shirts and leggings protects skin even better than sunscreen does, the agency said.  Opponents say the bill could increase skin cancer Dermatologists have already taken issue with the Hawaii and Key West bans out of fear they'll cause skin cancer rates to rise or create a stigma around sun protection.  The American Academy of Dermatology assured that sunscreen remains a safe, effective form of sun protection despite the bill and any claims that they were toxic to human health were ""unproven"" in a statement released months before Hawaii's bill passed in 2018. Skin cancer is still the most common form of cancer in the US, and it's steadily risen over the last several years, from about 66,000 in 2009 to more than 82,000 in 2016, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Florida has the second-highest rate of melanoma in the country, the CDC said, largely due to its proximity to the equator, where UV rays are strongest, and year-round, beach friendly weather.  If approved, Stewart's ban will enter effect in July 2020. But she said she's already received pushback from fellow legislators and doctors -- she lives in the Sunshine State, after all.  ""The reason for this bill is just to make sure that is discourages the use of those two chemicals,"" she said. ""I'm not doing this so everyone gets skin cancer. There are so many other sunscreens out there that are reef-safe.""  But there's no agreed-upon definition for what ""reef-safe"" means, according to Consumer Reports, so manufacturers aren't made to prove their impact on marine life.  Chemicals absorbed into skin -- for better or worse Even though the Food and Drug Administration allows the ingredients in sunscreen, there's insufficient evidence to show how the chemicals affect the human body beyond UV protection.  ""If it's hurting ocean life, it seems to me it might have some other effect on the human body,"" Stewart said.  A May study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that four active ingredients, including oxybenzone, are absorbed through the skin. Whether or not they're unsafe for the human body, though, requires more research.  Only two sunscreen ingredients are ""generally recognized as safe and effective"" for people by the FDA: Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. The agency has requested data from manufacturers for 12 active ingredients, including the two Stewart's bill would ban, to determine their health effects and inform new sunscreen regulations.  "
95,"Dashlane, the New York startup that provides a platform for users to manage their passwords and online identities across multiple sites and apps, has raised a further $22.5 million in funding and picked up a key strategic investor and partner in the process. TransUnion, a credit monitoring and ID protection company, led a Series C round, and it will use the deal to develop services with Dashlane for each other’s customers. Others in the round included existing investors Rho Ventures, FirstMark Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners. Dashlane has raised $52.5 million to date. Emmanuel Schalit, Dashlane’s CEO, said in an interview with TechCrunch that the company is not disclosing its valuation. More specifically: “We never have, and since the meaning of these numbers is shifting rapidly up and down and are so virtual, they don’t mean anything anymore, so we are not focused on that,” he said. The market for identity protection and password protection has perhaps never been stronger than it is today. There is a growing wave of mainstream services that you consume in the cloud that need you to authenticate who you are. But the instances of malicious hackers uncovering and using your credentials for nefarious purposes seem to be rising at an alarming rate. Those two forces have been a big boost for Dashlane’s business. Today, the company says it has more than 5 million consumers in over 150 countries, and it has enabled $6 billion in e-commerce transactions to date. As a point of comparison, two years ago when we covered the company’s previous round of funding, it had only 2 million users and helped process $1 billion in transactions. (Incidentally, the faster growth in transactions is also a mark of just how big a role online services plays in our lives today.) Schalit told TechCrunch that the funding will be used in a few different areas. The company plans to continue to build more sophisticated password-focused products for consumers — to complement existing ones, such as this handy service that lets you change passwords for multiple sites, all in one go. But it’s also building out its B2B e-commerce business, a key way that it fits with TransUnion’s focus. Most recently, Dashlane inked a deal with Citigroup-owned Banamex in Mexico and says it has deals in the works with other financial institutions. “We will have more partnerships with banks to help with services like fraud and online payment protection,” he said. While its consumer products are already sold on a freemium model, there is also an opportunity to sell more services to enterprises, he said. “We are seeng a lot of appetite for enterprise versions of what we are building,” Schalit noted. The third area is geographic expansion, with Dashlane already available across seven languages but with plans to add more. Developing markets seem to be a specific focus. “TransUnion is a leader in places like India,” he hinted. TransUnion is one of the very big players in the space of identity protection, but coming from a different angle: it works to help you manage your credit profile, and also works with large sites to protect their transactions. It’s been progressively making more moves to shift some of its business to focus on protection for individuals, and so this is where its interest and investment in Dashlane fits. It’s not TransUnion’s first move to tap into the startup world to build out its business: the company acquired Ireland’s TrustEv last year for $44 million to expand its e-commerce fraud protection business. As for what the two plan to do together, the companies are not yet releasing specific services but they will represent breaking new ground for both of them. “These integrated services will focus on credit monitoring, identity and fraud protection, credit information and breaches,” notes a statement. “TransUnion will also help Dashlane expand its distribution through TransUnion’s multiple partner channels in the U.S. and globally.” John Danaher, president of TransUnion Consumer Interactive, will also join Dashlane’s board. Schalit said the first services will come to the market in Q4 of this year. “We are impressed by Dashlane’s capabilities from a product and technology standpoint,” said Danaher in a statement. “Dashlane’s mission is straightforward, and the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from the ever-increasing need for simple, secure digital identity solutions. We feel TransUnion, with its vast array of credit and identity protection services and its global consumer reach, can help accelerate Dashlane’s growth even further.” Carl Pascarella, former CEO of Visa, has also joined Dashlane’s board with this round, as an independent director.  “Dashlane’s ability to facilitate payments and help reduce fraud is uniquely relevant for financial institutions,” said Pascarella.  “I am excited to have an opportunity to lend my experience to help the team at Dashlane accomplish their vision for secure information and online payments.”"
96,"Archer helps Rays beat Twins ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Chris Archer looked like his old self Saturday, holding the Minnesota Twins to three hits in six innings and leading the Tampa Bay Rays to a 7-3 win at Tropicana Field. “It’s not surprising,” Twins manager Paul Molitor said. “We all know he’s a very talented young man. He’s been trying to find ways to win games this year and tonight it seemed like he had it going.” Archer (6-15) had just one win in his previous 10 starts, and after zero runs of support in his last two outings, the Rays (45-64) helped him out Saturday with three solo home runs and some manufactured runs as well. Minnesota (44-66) missed out on a chance to shed the status of having the American League’s worst record. “Nice bounce-back win,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “I’m glad we came out more energized today. ... I thought Arch was good. He just ran out of pitches there at the end and drove his pitch count up a little bit in that last inning.” The Rays led just 3-1 in the sixth when Brad Miller beat out a possible double play at first. He stole second, stole third, then slid to avoid a tag at home on a grounder to short. That gave the Rays a 4-1 lead. Ryan Franklin, who had reached on the throw home, advanced on a single and then got third and home on wild pitches for a 5-1 lead. “Brad Miller is doing a lot of things for us — I loved the way he ran the bases today, aggressive, put himself in scoring position,” Cash said. “Just tremendous baserunning.” Logan Forsythe added a solo home run, his 11th of the season, in the seventh for a 6-1 lead. Bobby Wilson added an RBI single in the eighth, and Minnesota got two runs back in the ninth, with a fielding error setting up a two-run single by Jorge Polanco to cut the lead to 7-3. Reliever Danny Floro pitched badly enough to turn a 7-1 game into a save situation for Alex Colome, who got the final two outs for his 27th save with the tying run on deck. Archer struck out seven batters to give him 168 for the season, moving back ahead of Detroit’s Justin Verlander for the American League lead. Twins starter Jose Berrios (2-2) lasted five innings, giving up four run on six hits. “I’d say it was probably a fair outing,” Molitor said. “Command is still something he needs to improve on. ... It’s part of the process of getting up here and trying to figure things out.” Archer was in control from the start, limiting the Twins to two hits and no runs in the first five innings. He got help from stellar defense — when Eddie Rosario walked in the second and Polanco singled, center fielder Kevin Kiermaier came up throwing and got Rosario at third to end the inning. In the third inning, Danny Santana reached on an infield single, and Archer was able to follow that with an inning-ending double play off the bat of Brian Dozier. The Rays had success off Berrios from the very start. Forsythe singled to lead off the game, and with two outs, he scored on Miller’s RBI single off Dozier’s glove at second. Evan Longoria hit a solo homer — his team-best 24th — in the third inning and Wilson, in his first game with the Rays this season, hit his fourth homer overall this season in the fifth. NOTES: The Rays made a roster move before Saturday’s game, placing OF Desmond Jennings on the disabled list with a left knee contusion suffered when he fouled a ball off the knee in Tuesday’s game. They also activated OF Mikie Mahtook off the DL, where he had been since June 21 with a fractured hand. Jennings, limited by injuries for much of this season, was hitting .200 in 200 at-bats. Mahtook hit .154 with three RBIs in 65 at-bats with the Rays earlier this season. ... As announced Friday night, the Rays also placed LHP Enny Romero on the DL with a back strain and recalled RHP Danny Farquhar from Triple-A Durham. ... C Bobby Wilson, claimed off waivers from the Rangers earlier this week, made his season debut with the Rays, starting and batting ninth. Wilson, who also played for the Tigers and Rangers this season, had a .241 average entering the game. ... 1B Joe Mauer entered the game on a ridiculous hot streak, batting .636 (14-for-22) with eight RBIs in the first five games of Minnesota’s road trip. He was hitless in three at-bats on Saturday."

The ethos for this project was inspired by Cornell Capa, the center’s founder and first director, who died in 2008. Mr. Capa coined the phrase “concerned photographer,” someone who produces “images in which genuine human feeling predominates over commercial cynicism or disinterested formalism.” Established in 1974, the I.C.P. has chronicled wars, social movements and disasters to build an historical archive for future generations. This year, it moved to a new home at Essex Crossing, the large new Lower East Side development in Manhattan. The pandemic photo project was created out of a desire “to make a connection,” said Mark Lubell, the executive director of the I.C.P. “As the crisis continues, the images will reflect different phases of what we’re all experiencing,” he added. “Looking at it in real time reflects a sense of where we are at this moment.” Mr. Lubell contrasted this moment with the September 11th attacks, when there was “something to look at that was quite physical. We could photograph the aftermath of that,” he said. Documenting a virus is more complicated. “How do you photograph something that is not photographable?” Mr. Lubell pointed to recent submissions that have highlighted a sense of relationships and interconnectedness between people. “We’re photographing what we’re missing,” he said. “It’s really a humanitarian response.” Updated March 24, 2020"

Ryan said it may emerge this week, or they may hold it longer to gather more support. “If the momentum keeps building, like we see it is, then we may keep it open for a little while,” he said. “We want to make sure we have the maximum number on it.”  Rep.

If Pelosi and her allies are sweating the challenge, they for the most part aren’t showing it. No one has emerged as a challenger to Pelosi, cutting into arguments that she is really threatened. Pelosi predicted in no uncertain terms that she’ll retake the Speaker’s gavel she lost after the Democrats were walloped at the polls in 2010.  “I’m just going to say that I will be Speaker,” Pelosi said Wednesday morning, leaving a closed-door meeting of the Democratic Caucus in the basement of the Capitol. Pelosi, 78, has led the Democrats since 2003, ushering the party to a House majority in 2006, and becoming the first female Speaker in the country’s history in the process.  Yet her long tenure at the helm has increasingly agitated a newer crop of Democratic lawmakers who are pressing to wield more power in the top-heavy caucus. Many of them are calling for an ouster of not only Pelosi, but her top lieutenants — Reps.

But Pelosi’s opponents say if they can show in that meeting that Pelosi lacks the votes to win the Speakership in a public vote on the floor, she’ll back out of the race, sparking a new nomination contest among newer members. “We’ve got enough votes,” said Rep.

And “there are more signatures coming in,” he said. “I think you’ll be surprised,” Vela said. Sánchez’s office did not respond to a request for comment. The precise number of detractors needed to block Pelosi’s ascension remains unclear, because a number of midterm races around the country are still undecided. Based on projections, Pelosi could likely lose between 12 and 17 Democratic votes and still secure the gavel. Both sides have been leaning hard on the incoming Democratic freshman, who arrived in Washington Tuesday for a whirlwind orientation that’s found them bombarded with questions about their position on Pelosi. “Our new members are just basically under siege at this point,” said Rep. Marcia FudgeMarcia Louise FudgeHarris wins endorsement of former CBC Chairwoman Marcia Fudge The Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment MORE (D-Ohio), a Pelosi detractor who hasn’t ruled out her own run at the Speakership. A number of incoming freshman hail from conservative-leaning districts and had run campaigns vowing to oppose Pelosi if voters sent them to Washington. Several have asserted clearly that they’ll oppose her on the floor, a list that includes Rep.-elects Abigail Spanberger (Va.), Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) and Jason Crow (Colo.).  Other incoming freshman, however, were quick to announce their support.  “I’m from California; I’m a Democrat; I’m a woman,” said Rep.-elect Katie Hill, 31, who defeated Rep. Steve KnightStephen (Steve) Thomas KnightRepublican fighter pilot to challenge freshman Dem in key California race Freshman Dem endorses Harris’s 2020 bid GOP trading fancy offices, nice views for life in minority MORE (R) in Southern California. “I’m going to end up voting for her.” Pelosi spent Wednesday meeting with various different groups within the divisive caucus. In the morning, she huddled with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, some of whom have been critical of her leadership. Later in the day, Pelosi met with Democrats in the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of moderates seeking an overhaul to House rules. Some of them are hinging their Speaker vote on Pelosi’s endorsement of their reforms, and she wasted no time afterwards assuring them that changes are forthcoming. “We had a positive and constructive meeting, and will continue to work together to develop changes to the rules that will break the gridlock in Washington and deliver results for hard-working Americans,” Pelosi said afterwards in a statement.  Pelosi has also gathered support from a long and growing list of powerful outside groups, including labor unions, health-care organizations and abortion rights groups.  Her critics have responded that Pelosi is selfish to ask incoming freshman to support a leader they told voters they’d oppose — perhaps at risk of their reelections in 2020. “We have to do everything we can to keep all these new members here, to support them in whatever campaign promises that they made,” Rice said.  Amid the turbulent fight over Pelosi, the incoming freshman huddled with the caucus in the Capitol basement Wednesday for the first time since their elections. Hill, of California, said she’d delivered a message to the incumbents, on behalf of the newcomers.  “We just want to move on,” Hill said.  Melanie Zanona contributed.    View the discussion thread.

106,"Wine School The seasonal association of red wine with cold weather and white with warm seems to make sense. White wine is generally served colder than red, which suggests that it is more refreshing in the heat, and red is often sturdier, providing the necessary ballast in the cold. I don’t think that way. It’s not so much a question of the seasonal temperature as it is the diet. In the cold we more often want weightier meals, which generally call for reds, but we don’t entirely abandon dishes that call for whites. So we need white wines that have the heft to be satisfying in weather that could discourage more ethereal bottles. May I present Savennières from the Anjou region of the Loire Valley? It’s made with the chenin blanc grape, which often has a satisfyingly weighty texture as well as a lightness that comes from the grape’s naturally high acidity. Weighty yet light: It’s the beautiful paradox of chenin blanc. Savennières is a small appellation. Unlike Vouvray to the east, where chenin blanc is grown predominantly on clay and limestone soils, the grapes of Savennières are grown on schist. This helps to give the wines very different characters. The three Savennières I chose are: Domaine du Closel Savennières La Jalousie 2015 (Louis/Dressner Selections, New York) $32 Nicolas Joly Savennières Les Vieux Clos 2015 (David Bowler Wine, New York) $40 Thibaud Boudignon Savennières Les Fougerais 2015 (Skurnik Wines, New York) $60 These wines are all produced in small quantity, and they are virtually made by hand. I recognize that they are not inexpensive, but cheaper Savennières are even rarer than Savennières in general. If you cannot find these bottles (I know it may be difficult), do not hesitate to try other cuvées from these producers as well as other vintages. Producers absolutely worth seeking out include Château Soucherie, Château d’Épiré, Domaine aux Moines, Damien Laureau, Eric Morgat, Patrick Baudouin, Loïc Mahé, Agnès & René Mosse and Clément Baraut. With these wines, I would suggest firmer fish, like monkfish or tuna; shellfish, like lobster or scallops; poultry, and even veal. Savennières works well with cream sauces and with mushrooms. Risotto is another possibility. My colleague Florence Fabricant recommends this Moroccan-style Cornish hen recipe. Savennières is among the white wines that age well. These are particularly young specimens, perhaps too young. For that reason, you may consider decanting them, especially the Joly, whose proprietor suggests decanting certain cuvées 48 hours in advance. Just for comparison’s sake, have a taste before you decant to see how it changes. As always, don’t serve too cold. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Adam Kol, a couples financial counselor, doesn't plan on paying back his $350,000 student loan debt in full.Due to his current financial situation, it makes more sense economically for Kol to eschew payments and aim for loan forgiveness instead.In 2019, Kol paid nothing back due to his negligible income.Click here for more BI Prime stories.


Adam Kol, a couples financial counselor, has $350,000 worth of student loans.""All of the debt came from law school; specifically Duke University School of law in Durham, North Carolina — and then an LLM, which is basically a one-year masters in tax law that I got at NYU the year after I finished at Duke,"" he said on ""Beyond the Dollar."" ""To pay off $250, $300, $350,000 in debt, plus interest, that's going to be a nightmare unless I somehow started making a million bucks a year.""Today, the monthly payments that Kol makes are often not enough to cover the interest on his loans. ""The balance continues to rise and go up and up and up,"" he said. ""The amount of interest alone on $350,000 in debt is — at about 7% a year, just doing the quick math — is like $24,500 of interest a year. So we're talking 2 grand a month just to pay the interest.""He continued: ""As someone who's growing a small business right now, that would be a debilitating payment amount to make.""


Kol soon realized that paying his loans back in full wasn't a realistic option — and he started to vet other options. The goal was simple: keep his payments as low as possible.""Along the way, just looked at my options with my debt and said: 'You know what? I think that the economically advisable thing here is to pay as little as I can.'""Kol's inkling to skimp on his debt payments was confirmed by a student loan specialist and his accountant. Despite a swelling outstanding balance, it actually made more sense for him to pay less and adopt the loan forgiveness route. Travis Hornsby, the founder and CEO of Student Loan Planner, agrees. He says ""a lot of people don't need to pay back their debt,"" and ""You mostly hear the 'pay off your debt at all costs' mentality, and that's really bad advice for a lot of people.""Because of Kol's unconventional chosen path, he'll be in for a large tax bill when all is said and done.


""When the time comes, I'll have a big tax bill that year because the amount that's forgiven will be considered income, so I'll be preparing in the years leading up to that to pay for that bigger tax bill,"" he said. How he paid $0 in 2019Kol is currently on an income-based repayment plan, which means that his loan payments are calculated as a percentage of his discretionary income. The US government currently offers four different ""income-driven"" programs in order to help individuals with low income tackle their swelling debts.""When you certify your income, you can have that go for an entire year,"" he said. ""For 2019, I just didn't have a payment due. Formally, you could say I had a payment of zero dollars.""At the time, Kol was in the process of building his business. The costs associated with the venture brought his income down to a negligible amount. As a result, he paid $0 on his loans for a full-year.""The biggest advice that I can give is just keep taking the next step, even it's a small step,"" he said. ""Just take another step forward towards your vision, towards your dream, towards what it is you're creating and what you want to have."""

 The average wholesale cost of a 100 mg Viagra pill is now $88.45, an almost 20 percent increase from $73.85 at the beginning of 2018, according to the FT. Mid-year drug price increases are a common industry practice that has not abated, despite the Trump administration’s efforts.  The administration in May introduced a blueprint aimed at reducing drug prices. Trump promised companies would be announcing “massive, voluntary” price drops within two weeks. “I think we're going to have some big — some of the big drug companies in two weeks, and they're going to announce, because of what we did, they're going to announce voluntary, massive drops in prices,” Trump said at the time. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has hinted that Trump may use his bully pulpit to publicly shame companies that raise prices, but experts are skeptical it will have the desired effect. “I can imagine [Trump] is going to be very interested in the next company that takes a price increase not justified by inflation or change in clinical benefit,” Azar said during the rollout of the pricing blueprint in May. In a statement, Pfizer said the drugs in question amount to only a small percentage of their entire portfolio. ""The list price remains unchanged for the majority of our medicines. Our portfolio includes more than 400 medicines and vaccines; we are modifying prices for approximately 10% of these, including some instances where we’re decreasing the price,"" the company said. Pfizer also noted that even though list prices may rise, most patients or insurance companies will not pay the full amount because of discounts.

110,"Liberty University welcomed its students back to campus this week, despite explicit social distancing guidelines from both the White House and the state of Virginia amid the coronavirus outbreak. University President Jerry Falwell Jr., a longtime supporter of President TrumpDonald John TrumpNorth Korea asking for aid, while denying any coronavirus cases: report Iranian official maintains Tehran has 'no knowledge' of American hostage's whereabouts Unemployment claims surge to 3.2 million as coronavirus devastates economy MORE, said in a statement on Monday that he had been in conversation with the Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia to determine how to allow students who wanted to return to the evangelical college's Lynchburg campus to do so while still following the guidelines that have been put forward. “I was on a conference call with other college presidents and representatives from private colleges, and we listened to what other schools were doing,"" Falwell said. ""Many were throwing their hands up and saying they would just close and others were going to extend their breaks. At that time, we were on Spring Break, so we had time to work on it."" He added: “Our thinking was, ‘Let's get them back as soon as we can — the ones who want to come back.” Multiple universities, school districts and in some cases entire states — including Virginia — have canceled classes for the rest of the academic year in the face of the pandemic. Falwell told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that somewhere between several hundred to more than 5,000 students were expected to be living in Liberty's dorms as classes resumed Monday. “I think we have a responsibility to our students — who paid to be here, who want to be here, who love it here — to give them the ability to be with their friends, to continue their studies, enjoy the room and board they’ve already paid for and to not interrupt their college life,” he said. Despite the fact that almost all of Liberty's classes have been moved online, staff and faculty are still expected to come to work as usual. Falwell noted that the dining halls are operating in a takeout-only capacity and that special classes that need to meet in person, such as labs, will adhere to Gov. Ralph Northam's (D) 10-person gathering limit. Falwell has given voice to conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. Earlier in the month while on Fox News he said, ""You remember the North Korean leader promised us a Christmas present for America? Back in December. Could it be they got together with China and this is that present? I don’t know. But it really is something strange going on."" He told the Times-Dispatch that the university was protecting the students by having them on campus. “I think we, in a way, are protecting the students by having them on campus together,” he said. “Ninety-nine percent of them are not at the age to be at risk and they don’t have conditions that put them at risk.” Virginia has more than 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and Northam on Monday ordered all nonessential businesses to close by the start of Wednesday, though it is unclear how this mandate will affect the college. While the Lynchburg campus is open to students, faculty, staff, prospective students and their family members, it is closed to other visitors. The decision to have students on campus makes Liberty an outlier among universities around the country. Most schools have lengthened their spring breaks, moved learning online and instructed their students to return home. The Hill reached out to Liberty but was referred to the university's prior statements. View the discussion thread.

111,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China, fighting to stamp out poverty, will this year move more than two million of its poorest citizens from remote, inland regions to more developed areas, an official of the cabinet, or State Council, said on Tuesday. The mass relocation of people is a strategy targeted at lifting 10 million citizens out of poverty by 2020, state news agency Xinhua has said. Some of the villagers will move to areas with better social services, such as schools and hospitals, while others in remote areas will move to places with better roads and water supply, the official, Liu Yongfu, told a briefing. The numbers would be stepped up gradually and may eventually hit 3 million, added Liu, who heads the cabinet’s Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development. “We will talk it over with the localities and accumulate some experience, after that we will increase step-by-step,” he said. Despite two decades of rapid economic growth, poverty remains a huge issue in China, mainly in rural areas, where a lack of jobs drives out adults, leaving behind children and the elderly, often with limited access to schools and healthcare. China’s poor, who make up about 5 percent of a population of nearly 1.4 billion, live mostly in the countryside, and earn less than 2,300 yuan ($362) a year, government and state media say. In March Premier Li Keqiang promised a boost of 43 percent in funding for poverty relief programs. Last October, the cabinet said China aimed to lift all its 70 million poor above the poverty line by 2020. In December, Li urged local authorities to provide housing, healthcare, schooling and employment for relocated citizens. Since kicking off market reforms in 1978, China has lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty, but it remains a developing country and the reforms are incomplete, the World Bank says.

112,"Keeping score If Omar Vizquel had hit 400 home runs, no one would be debating his Hall of Fame credentials. Marrying that offensive figure with his stellar defensive reputation would have rubber-stamped his induction this year, his first on the ballot. But for all of the acclaim Vizquel earned for his play at shortstop over a 24-year career — including 11 Gold Glove Awards — advanced statistics say he never had a season as baseball’s top defensive player. He came close, finishing second in the majors in defensive wins above replacement in 1993, but never reached the top. There is, however, another first-time Hall of Fame candidate who had an extended run as one of the game’s top defenders, including at least one season as baseball’s best over all. He is Andruw Jones, who at his peak, as a center fielder for the Atlanta Braves, delivered some of the most impressive defensive seasons of any player in history while, almost as an aside, clubbing 434 career home runs. In other sports, it would be unthinkable to overlook a player so respected for defensive excellence. Deion Sanders became a first-ballot Hall of Famer in pro football. Dennis Rodman sailed into the Basketball Hall of Fame with a hearty endorsement from Michael Jordan. But despite having at least as many qualifications as Vizquel — and many other Hall of Fame candidates this year — Jones is getting very little support in his first year of eligibility, according to Ryan Thibodaux’s tracking of Hall of Fame balloting. Jones, who won 10 Gold Gloves, all in a row, from 1998 to 2007, was named on nine of the 178 ballots that had been made public on Thibodaux’s website as of Wednesday morning. Vizquel, whose offensive credentials pale next to Jones’s, was named on 53 ballots. If Jones had one fewer vote, he would be sitting below the 5 percent threshold for returning on the next Hall of Fame ballot. The contrast between Jones’s reputation among his peers and the voters is, to put it mildly, stark. “With all due respect to Willie Mays, who I never saw play, Andruw Jones is the best center fielder in our generation,” said Tom Glavine, the Hall of Fame pitcher who was Jones’s teammate for seven years in Atlanta. Glavine raved about the sense of security of having Jones roaming the outfield behind him, with that extraordinary anticipation of every fly ball, and he said Jones had the opposite effect on opponents. He unsettled them just by jogging out to his position. Ivan Rodriguez, a Hall of Fame catcher who played against Jones, noticed the same thing, and he described Jones’s impact as similar to that of a shutdown cornerback in the N.F.L. “He’s a guy that when you’re at the plate, the last thing you want to do is hit the ball to center field,” Rodriguez said. “He played very shallow, and you’d think you’re going to hit a ball over his head. And all of a sudden, he’d start running all the way to the wall, and there’s Andruw Jones making another great play.” Catcher Brian McCann, who played three seasons with Jones in Atlanta, joined Rodriguez and Glavine on a conference call this week that was part of their participation in the Diamond Resorts Invitational golf tournament near Orlando. When the subject of Jones and his Hall of Fame prospects came up, they began to speak over each other in hopes of making a case for him. Glavine, a fairly old-school player with an affinity for traditional statistics like wins and saves, made a surprising suggestion: Perhaps the number-crunchers of the game could build an argument for Jones. “I think he’s one of those guys that you really have to start to take a look at how he impacted the game on the defensive side of the ball,” Glavine said. “How the Hall of Fame voting committee goes about doing that, I don’t know, but there are certainly all kinds of sabermetrics in today’s game that I think could be applied to Andruw.” Glavine is right that analysis of defense has been refined in recent years. The most precise measure is a statistic called defensive runs saved, which was devised by Sports Info Solutions. The company uses game data and video to assess the quality and value of a fielder’s plays. For example, did he make a diving catch of a sinking line drive or did he break the wrong way, then trap a ball that he should have caught easily? Jones’s defensive peak, from 1997 to 2002, came just before Sports Info Solutions started tracking that statistic. While the number of runs Jones saved during those years is unknown, it is a testament to his excellence that from 2003 to 2007, as he began to decline, Jones still saved 67 runs. In the same time period, the second- and third-best defensive outfielders in baseball, Torii Hunter and Willy Taveras, combined for 68 (Hunter had 39, Taveras 29). Even after he had slowed down, Jones put a Babe Ruth-like distance between himself and his defensive competition. In another effort to assign a numeric value to a player’s defensive contributions, Baseball Reference created a formula for defensive WAR. The statistic has been tracked to 1871 — five seasons before the National League was created. By Baseball Reference’s assessment, Jones is the best defensive outfielder in history, his 24.1 defensive WAR trumping Paul Blair’s 18.6 and Mays’s 18.1. He led all players, regardless of position, in defensive WAR in 1998. Although runs saved has become a critical component of defensive WAR’s formula, John Dewan, the owner of Sports Info Solutions and the author of “The Fielding Bible,” said the best statistic for comparing players across eras was Bill James’s fielding win shares. It is part of James’s system of measuring a player’s contribution to his team’s wins, and it relies on a consistent formula through the years. By that measure, Jones ranks fourth among outfielders with 85.5 career fielding win shares, trailing only Tris Speaker (117.8), Mays (103.6) and Max Carey (94.8). Jones led the majors in the statistic for five consecutive seasons, from 1998 to 2002, and he was in the top six for fielding win shares 10 times in 11 seasons. For his part, James, regardless of what his statistic indicates, has publicly stated that he does not feel Jones's defense has been proven to be worthy of Hall of Fame consideration, but Dewan came to a different conclusion. “There is no question that Andruw Jones was one of the best defensive outfielders of all time,” Dewan said. Jones’s offensive statistics cannot truly compare to those of candidates like Chipper Jones and Jim Thome, but he more than held his own with the bat. Along with his 434 home runs, he both scored and drove in 1,200-plus runs. Jones also stole 152 bases and, according to adjusted on-base plus slugging percentage, which adjusts for a player’s home field and the league in which he played, he was 11 percent better than average at the plate for the duration of his career. In his nine-year offensive peak, Jones averaged 35 home runs and 104 runs batted in per season and had a slash line of .270/.347/.513. His bat exploded in 2005 for 51 home runs, and he followed that with 41 in 2006. Jones’s career began unraveling in 2008, when he joined the Los Angeles Dodgers as a free agent. He showed up overweight and sustained a severe knee injury that required surgery and stripped him of his defensive ability and much of his power. Had he remained healthy and corrected the conditioning flaws that preceded his injury, it is conceivable that he would have topped 500 home runs in his career, which might have been enough to sway Hall voters reluctant to back a player known mostly for his glove. In truth, Jones faces a difficult situation on the ballot because there is a glut of strong candidates. He is one of 12 players on this year’s list who compiled more than 60 career wins above replacement, and voters are limited to 10 choices. But for Jones, who was unquestionably the best defensive outfielder of his generation and among the greatest ever, being on the verge of ballot oblivion seems unjust when players who trail him by a substantial margin in WAR have received far more consideration. The list of players outpacing Jones in voting who cannot match his 62.8 career WAR includes not only Vizquel — who hit a scant 80 career home runs but is held to a different standard because he was a shortstop — but also Sammy Sosa, Gary Sheffield, Jeff Kent and Fred McGriff, who were one-dimensional in comparison with Jones. Even Vladimir Guerrero, who has been named on 94.4 percent of the revealed ballots, fell short of Jones in WAR, with 59.3. Perhaps if Jones survives this vote, which could clear as many as five players off the packed list, he will do better in future elections, especially if people make more of an effort to understand his overall value. Glavine, for one, thinks that Jones’s case can be made even if you focus on only one aspect of the game. “Defensively,” Glavine said, “there’s not a question in my mind that he’s a Hall of Famer.”"

Under the changes, the government will end the use of indefinite gag orders and limit its secrecy demands to the most serious of cases. Microsoft had filed suit back in April 2016. What's next: Both Microsoft and outside groups called on the Senate to pass a bill, which has already unanimously passed the House, that would limit gag orders to 180 days. Microsoft President and chief legal officer Brad Smith called the agreement an ""unequivocal win for our customers."" """"The binding policy issued today by the Deputy U.S. Attorney General should diminish the number of orders that have a secrecy order attached, end the practice of indefinite secrecy orders, and make sure that every application for a secrecy order is carefully and specifically tailored to the facts in the case,"" Smith said in a blog post. ""This is an important step for both privacy and free expression."" The Center for Democracy and Technology, which had filed a brief in the case, praised the agreement as ""an important improvement."" ""It allows Americans to learn when they are being investigated by the government and — if that investigation is improper — take action to protect their privacy,"" CDT policy VP Chris Calabrese told Axios. However, Calabrese cautioned that ""the guidance is not a substitute for statutory reform"" and urged Congress to take action."
114," (CNN)A series of five temblors struck California in about 18 hours, three of them near the small town of Cabazon, according to the US Geological Survey.  Just before 5 a.m. (8 a.m. ET) Tuesday, two small earthquakes struck within minutes of each other, roughly 7 miles north of the Southern California city of 4,000. Cabazon is about 45 miles east of the Los Angeles suburb, Riverside.  The first quake was a 4.5 magnitude, while the second was a 3.2, the USGS reported.  A third temblor, a 2.5 magnitude, hit a couple of miles south of the epicenter of the first two quakes around 10 a.m (1 p.m. ET), the agency said.  Residents in San Diego, 95 miles south of the 4.5 magnitude quake, felt the ""initial jolt,"" according to CNN affiliate KNBC. About 12 hours earlier, two more temblors hit opposite ends of the Golden State.  The first, occurring around 5:39 p.m. (8:39 p.m. ET) Monday, hit a few miles east of Ocotillo Wells, which lies 50 miles north of the Mexico border. It registered as a 2.5 magnitude.  Roughly an hour before the Ocotillo Wells temblor, a 4.5 magnitude quake hit in the Pacific Ocean, 56 miles west of the Northern California town of Ferndale. The city of 1,400 is known for its Victorian homes and storefronts and is considered the gateway to California's Lost Coast.  All five temblors struck at a depth of 7 to 10 miles, which seismologists consider shallow. Quakes between 2.5 and 5.4 are relatively frequent (30,000 a year) and can cause minor damage. "
115,"New York (CNN Business)Delta Air Lines says the next three months could be bumpy.  On Tuesday, the company forecast earnings per share of 70 cents to 90 cents, far below Wall Street estimates. A year ago Delta earned 74 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Delta also said a key measure of revenue from fares is likely to be flat.  The government shutdown is among the issues Delta faces, CEO Ed Bastian told analysts. He estimated that the airline is losing about $25 million in the month of January because of fewer bookings. That equates to about a 1% drop in expected revenue.  Bastian said Delta is also concerned about longer security lines because some TSA screeners who aren't being paid and are calling off sick. Bastian said Delta is talking with TSA and having its employees do some of the non-essential screening work that they're allowed to provide in an effort to limit the lines.  But Delta said the long lines have been sporadic and not spread evenly across all airports. And Bastian said he's not seeing any drop in bookings from customers who don't want to deal with the lines. ""We're not seeing any evidence that people are looking at this extended shutdown as anything other than something that's going to be resolved hopefully soon,"" he said. Bookings for the upcoming Martin Luther King holiday weekend and the President's Day weekend next month are strong. The airline also expects that it will see a delay in FAA approval for its Airbus 220. The FAA is one of the agencies seeing non-essential personnel furloughed during the shutdown. The smaller plane that is replacing some regional jets had been expected to begin service as soon as January 31.  ""The start date is likely to be pushed back due to delays in the certification process,"" said Bastian. ""This is also hampering our ability to put seven other new aircraft deliveries into service. We strongly encourage our elected officials to do their very best to resolve their differences and get our government fully open as quickly."" The shutdown started on December 22 and is now longest on record. About 800,000 government employees have been furloughed without pay. Shares of Delta (DAL) fell as much as 1.6% in premarket trading before rebounding and finishing slightly higher. The guidance also shook some of its competitors. American (AAL)  fell 1% before closing higher. Shares of United Continental Holdings, (UAL) were also down slightly before the bell, but the airline on Tuesday reported that fourth quarter profit had exceeded expectations. Stock closed up 1.6% and was up as much as 6% after the earnings report.  Earlier this month a warning from Delta that business travel was a bit softer than expected at the end of the fourth quarter was enough to send airline stocks sharply lower.   But Delta's fourth quarter results ended up not being all that bad.  Earnings were a few cents a share better than estimates, and overall revenue for the quarter fell in line with forecasts.  "
116,"The economy is better for President Trump's first midterm election than it was for either of Barack Obama's two midterm elections — largely because it has been steadily improving since the 2008 financial crisis.  Why it matters: In 2010, Democrats lost the House, and in 2014, they lost the Senate — two losses for Obama, and both under weaker economies than Trump has now. Yet it's very possible that Republicans will lose the House under Trump's watch despite the strong economy. “People get credit for what happens on their watch, whether they deserve it or not,"" said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a GOP economist. He added, though, that the tax cut and GOP deregulation effort have also helped. The bottom line: Trump can talk up the strong economy, but if Republicans lose the House on his watch, it will be hard to explain for any other reason than his unpopularity."

Moore, a frequent Trump critic, argued that ""Trump is in deep, deep trouble,"" citing recent turmoil surrounding the ouster of the president's first national security adviser Michael Flynn last week. The filmmaker proposed replicating events like last month’s Women’s March on Washington as often as possible and called on readers to “join some of our great national groups,” naming the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Black Lives Matter, Planned Parenthood and Democratic Socialists of America. “It’s critical that large numbers of us continue to march, protest, sit-in and be very visible — to Trump, so he knows we are the majority; to put the Dems on notice that we expect them to grow a spine; to our fellow Americans who live in Boise or Tulsa or Grand Rapids and have been feeling alone and afraid since the election,” Moore wrote.

119,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq is close to signing a $53 billion, 30-year energy agreement with Exxon Mobil and PetroChina, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday, denying any link between the mega-project and U.S. permission for Iraq to do business with Iran.  Iraq expects to make $400 billion over the 30 years the deal will be in effect, the prime minister said.  The southern mega-project involves the development of the Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi oilfields and raising production from the two fields to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from around 125,000 bpd now, Abdul Mahdi said.   The project is crucial to supplying water to oilfields in the south in order to boost pressure and keep production steady.  Media reports had quoted Iran’s ambassador in London on Monday saying the United States would grant waivers to Iraq allowing it to deal with Iran economically, in exchange for Baghdad signing an oil deal with Washington.  “Talks now between the oil ministry and Exxon Mobil and PetroChina are focused on how to split profits if oil prices rise or decline,” Abdul Mahdi said in response to a Reuters question on the obstacles holding up a final agreement.  “The deal lasts for 30 years and such financial details are sensitive and should be given more discussions,” he added.  Iraq is the second largest oil exporter in OPEC and has long-term aims to boost output curtailed by decades of war and sanctions. Such projects are among the most valuable prizes in the world for international oil companies. An initial agreement would be a big boost for Exxon Mobil’s plans to expand in Iraq.  It is also one of the only countries in the world to have friendly relations with both the United States and Iran. Tehran and Washington, arch enemies elsewhere, are Baghdad’s main allies and vye for influence there.  Exxon Mobil and PetroChina will build a water injection project to feed oil wells in the south, as well as rehabilitate and build new export pipelines, Abdul Mahdi said.  The project also aims to process 100 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Artawi and Nahr Bin Umar fields.  U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out last year from a 2015  nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, and reinstated sanctions against Tehran. Washington has told buyers of Iranian oil to stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions.  Iraq does not import oil and has a waiver from the United States allowing it to import Iranian natural gas.  “The U.S. sanctions are against countries that buy Iranian oil only, and Iraq doesn’t buy any Iranian crude. For gas, as far as I know (waivers ending) won’t affect (gas imports) right now. The waiver for gas still stands,” an Iraqi oil official told Reuters on Monday.

127," (CNN)President Donald Trump has begun the initial steps of preparing for a possible interview with the special counsel, a White House official and a person familiar with the situation said Friday, a sign the President's legal team is intensifying its deliberations over whether to allow him to come under Robert Mueller's questioning. One source familiar with the proceedings stressed the preparation efforts is ""in its infancy."" The preparations have been short and informal and included going over potential topics with the President that Mueller would likely raise in an interview, the people said. The President has not formally agreed to sit for an interview with Mueller. But word of early preparations is the clearest sign yet that Trump and his team remain open to an interview with Mueller, despite concerns from some people close to the President that such an interview could expose him to possible charges of perjury. Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer handling Mueller issues, and Jay Sekulow, the President's attorney, declined to comment.  Interview prospects Outwardly, Trump has remained receptive to -- even enthusiastic about -- the prospect of sitting before Mueller, who is investigating whether his campaign colluded with Russia and whether Trump attempted to short-circuit the investigation itself. He has indicated that sitting for an interview himself could help bring the investigation to a swift end. Privately, however, Trump has been more equivocal about answering Mueller's questions, depending on the day. Trump has wavered on his pledge as friends and advisers caution him of the risks of speaking to prosecutors who have already charged 19 individuals with criminal offenses, including lying.  The terms of how Trump would be questioned -- including whether he would speak under oath -- have not yet been determined. Even if he isn't questioned under oath, however, Trump could still open himself to charges if he lies to Mueller's team, since lying to the FBI is a crime. Trump told reporters in January he was ""looking forward"" to an interview with Mueller, insisting there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. ""I'd love to do it,"" Trump said, indicating that he'd been told by his lawyers an interview would take place in ""two to three weeks."" Two-and-a-half months later, Trump's legal team has not committed to making Trump available to Mueller for an interview. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said this week that talks were continuing between Trump and his lawyers about a possible interview with Mueller. ""The President is working in conjunction with his legal team and making a determination,"" Sanders said on Tuesday. ""We're continuing to be fully cooperative with the Office of the Special Counsel, and we'll continue driving the same message that we've been driving for over a year, that there was no collusion."" Investigation status While Trump himself has not been submitted for questioning to Mueller, multiple White House officials have been made available to Mueller's team. The White House has also produced reams of documents for the special counsel. Multiple aides to the President continue to describe him as obsessed with the Russia investigation, becoming increasingly agitated as details about the probe emerge. Trump feels the investigation undermines his presidency and has grown increasingly bitter that it has not yet concluded, the aides have said. Members of the President's legal team have been negotiating for months with Mueller's office over potential topics that may be included in a presidential interview. Attorneys on both sides sat down late last month in a rare face-to-face discussion about the topics investigators could inquire of the President. It was the first in-person meeting after several weeks of informal discussions between the two sides, according to two sources familiar with the talks. In that session -- which Mueller himself did not attend -- the special counsel's team provided more specific details about the topics it had originally presented to Trump's lawyers months ago, which include the firing of FBI Director James Comey, attorney general Jeff Sessions involvement in that firing and Trump's knowledge of phone calls national security adviser Michael Flynn placed to the Russian ambassador in late 2016. Deliberations over an interview with Mueller have proceeded amid tumult within the President's legal team. Midway through March, the lead lawyer, John Dowd, resigned amid disagreements with the President and increased scrutiny in the probe. That's left Jay Sekulow, an outside attorney, and Cobb, who works in the White House, as the remaining lawyers representing the President in this matter. At least five major law firms have been invited -- but declined -- invitations to help Trump navigate the Mueller investigation. CNN's Evan Perez contributed to this report."
128,"PHILADELPHIA — Five versions of van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” painting will be showcased simultaneously on Facebook Live on Monday in a collaboration among art museums on three continents. The paintings will be interpreted by curators from museums in London, Amsterdam, Munich, Philadelphia and Tokyo, who will deliver a sequence of live 15-minute commentaries while standing with the works in the museums. Ahead of the curatorial events, the museums will also use their own Facebook pages, starting on Thursday, to simulate the experience of viewing all five paintings in a gallery, allowing the audience to compare and examine them as if they were in a three-dimensional environment. The virtual gallery will include narration by van Gogh’s great-grand-nephew, Willem van Gogh, who will share memories of the paintings, which were created in 1888-9 for a visit by the artist Paul Gauguin to van Gogh’s house in Arles, France. The Facebook Live event is being led by the National Gallery in London, which in 2014 brought together its own version of “Sunflowers,” and that of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, for the first time in 65 years. Jennifer Thompson, curator of the Facebook Live event at the Philadelphia Museum of Art — which houses the only version of “Sunflowers” in the United States — said she believed it was the first time that art museums in different countries had used social media to highlight works that are unlikely to be seen together in one physical space. “It’s a fun and engaging way to think about these five paintings that are scattered about the globe, that are unlikely to ever come together in one venue or one exhibition,” Ms. Thompson said. “This is a way for us to take advantage of technology to virtually bring the paintings together, and to have a conversation among curators.” She said that the “Sunflower” paintings were among the public favorites at all the participating museums, and that the event was an opportunity to highlight van Gogh’s choice of color and texture and his love of nature. Each curator will talk about a different aspect of the paintings, Ms. Thompson said. For example, she will focus on van Gogh’s repetition of subject, while her colleague from the Neue Pinakothek in Munich will talk about his use of color. Ms. Thompson said she would distinguish the Philadelphia and Munich versions of the paintings — which both have turquoise backgrounds — from later versions in the other three museums, which have yellow backgrounds. The Facebook Live event will begin with the London presentation, starting at 12:50 p.m. Eastern time, and conclude with that of the Tokyo curator (from the Seiji Togo Memorial Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Museum of Art), starting at 2:10 p.m. Eastern time."
129,"MARSH HARBOUR, Bahamas (Reuters) - Richard Johnson said his six-year-old brother Adrian was just too small to withstand Hurricane Dorian. The boy was blown into churning storm surge and is among thousands of people missing, many of them children, after the worst hurricane to hit the Bahamas. It was one of many harrowing stories emerging on Thursday as residents searched for loved ones and widespread looting was reported on the islands, where the United Nations estimates 70,000 people are in immediate need of food, water and shelter. An international relief effort was trying to overcome formidable logistical challenges to help the Bahamas, where the health minister predicted a “staggering” death toll from Hurricane Dorian, now churning northward off the coast of South Carolina. “I guess within seconds the gusts of the wind blew the little boy off the roof into the water,” Johnson said of his brother. “Given the circumstances, I’m not that hopeful.” Aerial video of the Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas, worst hit by the then-Category 5 hurricane, showed widespread devastation, with the harbor, shops and workplaces, a hospital and airport landing strips damaged or decimated. The death toll from Dorian stood at 30 on Thursday evening, officials told CNN, The final toll is expected to be much higher. “Let me say that I believe the number will be staggering,” Health Minister Duane Sands was quoted by The Nassau Guardian as telling Guardian radio. “... I have never lived through anything like this and I don’t want to live through anything like this again.” Dorian turned a shantytown known as The Mud near Marsh Harbour into shredded wreckage, with bodies believed to be still below the ruins, based on the smell coming from the debris, according to a Reuters photographer who visited the area. The photographer witnessed widespread looting in Marsh Harbour, seeing residents breaking into liquor stores and supermarkets, carrying off goods in bags or filling their vehicles. The U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said on Thursday it was organizing an airlift from Panama of storage units, generators and prefab offices for two logistics hubs, as well as satellite equipment for emergency responders, and has bought eight metric tonnes of ready-to-eat meals. The U.N. agency has allocated $5.4 million to a three-month emergency operation to support 39,000 people, said WFP Senior Spokesperson Hervé Verhoosel. A flight from the U.S. Agency for International Development landed early on Thursday with enough relief supplies to help 31,500 people, bringing hygiene kits, water containers and buckets, plastic sheeting and chain saws. Total insured and uninsured losses in the Bahamas amounted to $7 billion, including buildings and business interruptions, according to a preliminary estimate by Karen Clark & Co, a consultancy that provides catastrophic modeling and risk management services. With telephones down in many areas, residents posted lists of missing loved ones on social media. One Facebook post by media outlet Our News Bahamas had 2,500 comments, mainly listing lost family members. One survivor on the Abaco Islands, Ramond King, said he watched as swirling winds ripped the roof off his house, then churned to a neighbor’s home to pluck the entire structure into the sky. “‘This can’t be real, this can’t be real’,” King recalled thinking. “Nothing is here, nothing at all. Everything is gone, just bodies.” The Netherlands’ ambassador to the United Nations tweeted the country was sending two naval ships with supplies from St Maarten, a Dutch island about 1,100 miles (1,770 km) southeast of the Bahamas. Jamaica was sending a 150-member military contingent to help secure Abaco and Grand Bahama, officials said. Volunteers also ferried supplies to the islands in a flotilla of small boats. Cruise lines responded as well. The Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line said it would transport first responders, medics and journalists for free to Freeport on Thursday, returning to Florida on Friday with any Bahamians who have documents to enter the United States. “It’s a humanitarian trip. We’re also taking donations that have arrived in the port (in Palm Beach),” said Francisco Sanchez, a sales representative for the cruise line. Royal Caribbean’s Empress of the Seas said it was delivering 10,000 meals of chicken, rice and fruit to Grand Bahama. Dorian hovered over the Bahamas for nearly two days with torrential rains and fierce winds that whipped up 12- to 18-foot (3.7- to 5.5-meter) storm surges. On Thursday, the storm was barreling north-northeast just off the southeastern U.S. coast, moving at about 7 miles per hour (11 kph), with maximum sustained winds fluctuating between 110 and 115 mph (175-185 kph), between a Category 2 and Category 3 storm on the five-point Saffir-Simpson wind scale.

Before joining Brown, he analyzed search behavior at Microsoft Research, Google, Yahoo, and Bing, and cofounded World Blender, a Techstars-backed company that made geolocation mobile games.For 12 years he's used a simple productivity system that he calls his ""secret weapon"": tracking everything in a single text file.First, he puts everything on an online calendar, and then at the end of every day adds the next day's activities to his text file as a to-do list.He takes notes during the day on the different activities and uses shorthand so he can track them.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.


The biggest transition for me when I started college was learning to get organized. There was a point when I couldn't just remember everything in my head. And having to constantly keep track of things was distracting me from whatever task I was doing at the moment.So I tried various forms of to-do lists, task trackers, and productivity apps. They were all discouraging because the things to do kept getting longer, and there were too many interrelated things like past meeting notes, calendar appointments, idea lists, and lab notebooks, which were all on different systems.







I gave up and started just tracking in a single text file and have been using it as my main productivity system for 12 years now. It is so essential to my work now, and has surprisingly scaled with a growing set of responsibilities that I wanted to share this system. It's been my secret weapon.PrerequisiteA calendar. The one outside tool I use is an online calendar, and I put everything on this calendar, even things that aren't actually for a fixed time like ""make a coffee table at the workshop"" or ""figure out how to recruit new PhD students"" — I'll schedule them on a date when I want to think about it. That way all my future plans and schedule are together, and not a bunch of lists I have to keep track of.Making the daily listEvery night before I go to bed, I take all the items on my calendar for the next day and append it to the end of the text file as a daily to-do list so I know exactly what I'm doing when I wake up. This list contains scheduled tasks (2 p.m. meeting with Madonna, 4 p.m. office hours), errands (sign a form, return a book), and work items (review a paper, prepare a presentation). It also lets me think about whether I've got the right amount of work for a day.


Anything I don't want to do tomorrow, I'll shuffle back into my calendar on later dates. After 12 years of doing this, I've gotten pretty good at estimating what I can finish in a day.Here's an example with names replaced so you can see what it looks like when I move a day's schedule from my calendar.2017-11-31

As a recordThat daily to-do list is where I also take notes, so it's a to-do list that turns into a what's done list. The best thing about these daily lists is I keep them all in a single text file separated by dates so I have a record of everything I have ever done and when I did it.My current file was created almost seven years ago, when I started my current job. It serves as a research notebook, and as meeting minutes. I have 37,773 handwritten lines in one file now, documenting everything I have done as a professor and nearly every person I have met with, along with notes about what we discussed or ideas I had.Here's what my list looks like at the end of the day, representing work accomplished.2017-11-3111:00am meet with Head TAs

- ask about connection with computer vision- cool visual+audio unsupervised comparison, thoughtful about missing data, would work with ugrads (?), likes biking, teach compvis + graphics- vote #HIRE#note maybe visit Monsters University next spring, Bono does related workShortcuts and featuresI use a consistent writing style so things are easily searchable, with a few shorthands. When I search for ""meet with,"" it shows that I have had over 3,000 scheduled meetings. I have some tags like #idea for new ideas to revisit when I want project ideas, #annual for things to put on my next annual report, #nextui for things to add the next time I run my next UI course.


A text file is incredibly flexible, and at any point I can quickly glance to see what I've done that day and what's left. When a task is completed, which is the most common default, I just leave it. I can calculate aggregate statistics using the search box, or list all the lines containing a tag and other operations using my text editor. I use Ultraedit because I'm familiar with it, but I imagine any text editor would have similar capabilities.EmailEmail is obviously a part of my workflow. Everyone has all sorts of productivity advice about handling it, but I find a simple flagging system is sufficient — flag red if it's something I need to deal with, flag orange if I need to deal with it eventually but requires some thinking or someone else to handle it, and flag yellow for emails I send that I am waiting on a reply for so I know to follow up later. I'll flag emails as they come in, whenever it's convenient.At the end of the day, I'll do a quick review of the orange and yellows to see if any need to be followed up or should become red. Some peoples' workflows revolve around obsessively cleaning their Inbox. I don't really care about keeping my inbox empty because then I feel like I have new work to do whenever email comes in.So my daily routine looks like:Look at the daily to-do list I wrote last night to find out what I'm doing todayDo scheduled things on that list during the dayWhen I have free (unscheduled) time, do the floating tasks on my list and work on red-flagged emails at the end of the dayDo a quick review of orange/yellow emails to see if they need any handlingCopy the next day's calendar items to the bottom of the text file


This process has a few nice properties:It's easy to immediately see what to do when I wake up.I don't need to remember in my head the things to do later (following up on emails, future tasks).It's easy to recall what happened in the past and see how much I can actually accomplish in a day.There's no running ""to-do"" list with items that keep getting pushed back day after day.I use Remote Desktop so everything is accessible from every device.My daily workload is completely under my control the night before; whenever I feel overwhelmed with my long-term commitments, I reduce it by aggressively unflagging emails, removing items from my calendar that I am no longer excited about doing, and reducing how much work I assign myself in the future.It does mean sometimes I miss some questions or don't pursue an interesting research question, but helps me maintain a manageable workload.Jeff Huang is an assistant professor in computer science at Brown University.

131,"It is simply unacceptable that in 2017, so many Americans undergo a non-traumatic limb amputation each year. Yet, as we recognize Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Awareness Month this September, estimates suggest between 160,000 and 180,000 Americans lose one of their limbs every year — about half of which are attributable to preventable vascular diseases. This figure includes 43,000 Medicare beneficiaries, according to Avalere. This must change. As a public health crisis, PAD not only results in tens of thousands of preventable amputations, it also disproportionately impacts ethnic and racial minorities and costs taxpayers billions in additional spending.    Compounding these issues is the fact that lifetime care for a person with limb loss can average as much as $500,000. Studies also show that patients who receive a first amputation are at an elevated risk of having to undergo another amputation and a significantly increased risk for mortality.  Fortunately, we already have the technology to identify and treat PAD before it progresses to a point where an amputation is required. We just need a comprehensive strategy to get the right treatment to the right people. If we are going to get serious about reducing limb loss from PAD, the US must adopt a new strategy that integrates increased public awareness and robust screening with non-amputation treatment measures and multidisciplinary care. First, we must raise awareness about PAD. While as many as 18 million Americans are estimated to be living with the disease, many are completely unaware of the risks and thus may not seek care until it’s too late. Policymakers should consider what more we can do to ensure that there is a dedicated awareness effort to encourage doctors to make patient education a priority. Second, more could be done to increase PAD screening for those already identified to be at risk. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend that all patients who smoke, are over 65, or have a history of diabetes or another vascular disease be screened for PAD. CMS should work to implement these screening guidelines so that no at risk patient is left unscreened. Earlier in the PAD disease progression, less invasive options such as medical therapy or even supervised exercise therapy can be helpful once the disease has been identified. Third, policies should ensure that patients who are later in their disease progression are assessed for other treatment options before they undergo an amputation. We know techniques such as minimally-invasive revascularization can be used to clean clogged arteries in the legs and avoid amputation all together. However, studies show that as many as one third of late-stage PAD patients never receive arterial testing to evaluate whether they may be a candidate for this procedure. Finally, there must be a strong effort to expand multidisciplinary care for at-risk patients. Hospitals and treatment centers that have adopted comprehensive amputation prevention programs have been successful in driving amputation rates to near zero. At the same time, however, the evidence shows that certain specialties are much more prone to amputate than revascularize. As a result, policymakers should consider ways to encourage multidisciplinary care to ensure the option to save a patient’s limb is considered.  The price of developing PAD should not be limb loss, especially when the technologies exist to identify these patients and save their limbs. This September, I hope that policymakers, providers and patients will take a moment to better understand PAD. Only then can we work together to save lives and limbs, and make non-traumatic amputations a thing of the past. Jeffrey Carr, MD is an interventional cardiologist and endovascular specialist. He is the founding and immediate past president of the Outpatient Endovascular and Interventional Society, a multispecialty medical society. He is also the physician lead for the CardioVascular Coalition, a group dedicated to raising awareness for PAD and advocating for national health care policy and amputation prevention.

132," (CNN)Huge swaths of the South, Midwest and East Coast are under the gun for severe weather as states still recovering from last weekend's tornadoes hunker down for more.  On Thursday, ""the greatest threat for tornadoes will be along the Gulf Coast states of Mississippi and Alabama,"" CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. The National Weather Service said Thursday afternoon that a large and damaging tornado had been observed in southern Mississippi. The massive storm system won't leave the South quietly, either. It'll fan out to the Ohio Valley region and then the East Coast, threatening 100 million people with severe weather Thursday and Friday.  ""Severe thunderstorms may produce damaging gusts, a few tornadoes (possibly strong), and isolated large hail today across the lower Mississippi Valley through the central Gulf Coast region,"" the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said.  In Louisiana, the forecast is so dire that New Orleans City Hall and other local government offices were to close early Thursday, the mayor's office said. New Orleans was being pounded by the storm during the afternoon. ""Showers and thunderstorms continue through most of our area and heading eastward,"" the weather service office in New Orleans tweeted just after 4 p.m. ""Severe weather is still possible."" A weather station in Ethel, Louisiana, reported almost 3 inches of rain for a six-hour period Thursday.  Where are these storms headed?  This storm system will barrel toward the East Coast through Friday, unleashing tornadoes, damaging winds and hail from the Texas Panhandle to the coast of the Carolinas. By early Friday morning, it will move through Georgia, then through other coastal Atlantic states.  Dangerous conditions will ramp up throughout the day Friday along the East Coast, spreading from the southern tip of Florida to all the way to Washington, DC. Track the storms here >>> Who's at the greatest risk Friday?  The coastal parts of the Carolinas and southeastern Virginia have the greatest potential Friday for severe weather. That area is at ""enhanced risk,"" the Storm Prediction Center said, referring to the third level of severity on a scale of five. Damaging winds and tornadoes could strike the Southeast and mid-Atlantic states, especially within the ""enhanced risk"" area. The threat should diminish throughout the overnight hours into Saturday as the cold front linked to the storms finally pushes off shore. CNN's Taylor Ward, Steve Almasy, Allie Mazurek and Keith Allen contributed to this report."
133,"Imagine reading this: ""Twelve months before the election, the Russian security services were authorized to spend $1,000,000 on 'spoiling operations'. News stories were planted, editorial comment encouraged, rumors whispered, and fake social media accounts created."" Congressional investigations would launch.  News anchors would report breathlessly on the latest evidence of “collusion.”  The FBI would be pressured to investigate. Fingers would point at social media companies for “allowing” such a travesty of justice to happen on their watch. Except this didn't happen in the 2016 elections.   In his autobiography ""A Look Over My Shoulder: A Life in the Central Intelligence Agency,"" Richard Helms, described how the CIA accomplished this. “Posters were printed, news stories planted, editorial comment encouraged, rumors whispered, leaflets strewn, and pamphlets distributed.” Influencing elections isn't a new tactic. The use of social media is only a new tool in a long-running influence war. To single out platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google and others is short-sighted.  No nation has ensured free, fair and open elections through finger pointing. To put the onus on the shoulders of these companies is to outsource the security of the United States. It isn't their job to be the front line of defense. Nor can one defend themselves in cyberspace when deprived of the very information they need. Reasonable people understand the need for government to keep a certain amount of secrets. What they don't understand is the excuse ""There's too much data. We're overwhelmed."" Try that excuse during an IRS audit. It recently became public knowledge that the FBI was aware of Russian hacks into the private email accounts of government and military officials, but sat on the information for over a year. Their own policy states, in part, ""Because timely victim notification has the potential to completely mitigate ongoing and future intrusions ...CyD's policy (Cyber Division) policy regarding victim notification is strongly designed to favor victim notification. Even when it may interfere with another investigation or USIC operation, notification should still be considered..."" Out of 80 interviews done by the AP, only two got a heads-up from the FBI. The targets included current and former government officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, North American Aerospace Defense Command, Defense Intelligence Agency, Air Force Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and more.  Transparency is a two-way street. The vast majority of private sector companies with bad actors on their platforms cooperate willingly with federal authorities (there are always notable exceptions). Is it too much to ask that the FBI follow its own policy of notification? Government needs to make sure tech companies are partners by design, and not adversaries. If government was half as responsive as the private sector, Congress would fund another 500 FBI agents. Yet Facebook is already hiring another 1000 people to review political ad purchases. There is another way to solve a common problem, and that is to work together. The desire to influence future elections, or attack our critical infrastructure, isn't going away. You take the world as you find it, not as you wish it was.  Create a model to allow the private sector to war game future threats in cooperation with the government. Share information and intelligence. The government could stop more attacks if they would quit hiding behind the cloak of secrecy about “sources and methods.” While it sounds sexy, no one really cares where the information comes from, or from who. What the private sector wants, including state and local law enforcement, is the what and when.  World War II was won as much by production of rifles, bullets and airplanes as it was the military who used them. No one expected the factory worker to parachute into Normandy and fight the battle. But they were all part of the same team. Don't expect Facebook, Twitter, Google, Instagram or YouTube to be the only front line of defense. Instead, work together and unleash the awesome power of innovation. Stop the threats before they start. Show our adversaries the bloody nose they're going to get if they foolishly try to attack our Republic again. The bully usually quits when you fight back. So, let's fight back instead of each other.

134,"The German family that owns Panera Bread and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts will donate millions of dollars to an unspecified charity after discovering the family's collaboration with the Nazis during World War II, according to multiple reports. The Reimanns, after commissioning an investigation into their ancestry, learned that the family had used forced labor provided by Russian civilians and French prisoners of war in its businesses and private villas and donated to Nazi organizations as early as 1931, a spokesman told CNN. Albert Reimann Sr., who died in 1953, and his son, who died in 1984, were both committed members of the Nazi party, according to a Bloomberg report based on the German newspaper Bild. Reimann Sr. was also reportedly a financial backer of the Nazi SS as early as 1933. The two ""have passed away, but they actually belong in prison,"" Peter Harf, a spokesperson for the family, told Bild, according to CBS News. The full investigation will be made available in 2020, but after learning of the family’s Nazi connections, the Reimanns have pledged $11 million to an unnamed charity, according to Bloomberg.

135,"(Reuters) - U.S. investment firm Gurnet Point Capital is nearing a deal to acquire Ireland-based specialty drugmaker Innocoll Holdings Plc INNL.O, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The deal would add the Innocoll’s suite of collagen-based medicines to Gurnet Point’s portfolio of life science businesses. Should the negotiations be completed successfully, a deal could be announced as early as this week, the people said. Gurnet’s offer includes a cash component and a performance-based payment that could greatly enhance the value of the deal if certain milestones are reached, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Gurnet Point declined to comment. Innocoll did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Innocoll’s stock dropped by as much as 65 percent late last year after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected its application to market a drug called Xaracoll, which was to be used in treatment of post surgical pain. Since then, its stock has partly recovered. Innocoll has a market capitalization of around $50 million. In March, Innocoll said regulators had pointed to a path forward for Xaracoll that would require additional research and development and could result in a resubmission of its new drug application by the end of the year. Innocoll’s pharmaceutical portfolio aims to treat a variety of ailments, including post-surgical pain management, diabetic foot infections, and the prevention of surgical adhesions. Its products, some of which are currently marketed and some of which are still in development, rely on a collagen-based technology aimed at improving drug delivery and performance. Collagen is a protein that is found in skin and other connective tissues, and is frequently used in cosmetic surgery treatments. Gurnet Point Capital is backed by Waypoint Group, a family office headquartered in Geneva that invests on behalf of biotechnology billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli and his family.

136,"As many Americans reel from Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE’s election to the presidency, we must channel our disappointment, anger, and fear into purposeful action. We do not know whether Trump will follow through on many of his inflammatory campaign promises. If our worst fears are realized, it will be our collective responsibility to challenge policies that are discriminatory, defend our country’s humanitarian obligations, and unfalteringly promote the democratic rule of law at home and abroad. It isn’t enough to become civically engaged on behalf of our own causes. It is equally important to understand what motivated nearly half of the American voters to choose Donald Trump, and build amicable relationships with them. After all, just as many of us are angry about the injustice against minority groups, a significant number of Trump voters are angry about the injustices they perceive. While some of his supporters were certainly drawn to his divisive, bigoted rhetoric and scapegoat politics, many others are members of the working and middle classes. These voters simply felt that Trump responded to their concerns, which were due, at least in part, to socio-economic shifts and job losses resulting from globalization. Although not explicit, this conclusion stems from voters’ deep desire for change in this election, and Trump embodied this change, as he did not represent typical Washington politics. It is crucial for both parties to respond to these legitimate concerns, and for individuals to avoid casting Trump voters as a homogenous group of rednecks or racists. Addressing these concerns is vital to reconciling the chasms between voters and politicians, as well as between the two major political parties. However, these concerns do not justify overt or tacit acceptance of discrimination against minority groups. We must fight this discrimination not only by challenging political rhetoric that normalizes it, but also by promoting interaction and understanding between communities. This can be done both inside and outside the government, by mobilizing communities, volunteering for nonprofit and non-governmental organizations, and donating money to those organizations if our financial circumstances allow it. For example, in response to Islamophobia and fear of terrorism that manifests in a potential ban on Muslim refugees, anger alone will not solve anything. We should establish programs that promote interaction between people who might not live in ethnically or religiously diverse communities and Muslim and refugee communities, similar to programs designed to promote peace between Israelis and Palestinians. A similar model would also be relevant when addressing concerns associated with illegal immigration and discrimination against Latin American immigrants, to demonstrate that economic migrants share many of the same concerns — providing for their families, accomplishing educational and professional goals, being part of a community, etc. — as American workers. Such programs should emphasize the necessity of comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform and provide opportunities for grassroots coalition-building. This will allow communities to advocate on behalf of their common goals rather than perpetuating “us versus them” mentalities where immigrants are viewed as threats to one’s personal security. By creating a vehicle for understanding each other’s stories and values, we all might learn that the distance between us is far smaller than we think. All of this is easier said than done, but the effort is crucial. If we channel our anger into productive conversation and activism that bridges our differences, our democracy and policies will be more fair, effective, and resilient.

137,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo is investing in a startup called FreeWire whose rapid charging systems for electric cars are being installed across BP gasoline stations in Europe this year. Fast charging is a crucial factor in luring customers to electric cars, reflected in moves across the sector. BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) for instance have jointly pledged to open 400 ultra-fast charging stations in Europe by 2020, aiming to close the gap with Tesla. Yet Volvo, owned by China’s Geely Holding [GEELY.UL] and whose XC40 sport utility vehicle will be its first all-electric offering in a strategy to generate half of its sales annually from fully electric cars by 2025, has said it does not see itself owning service or charging stations. Through its Volvo Cars Tech Fund, the Swedish company said it had bought a stake in FreeWire, though it gave no further details. The fund’s CEO Zaki Fasihuddin said Volvo expected an already visible shortage of charging points to grow in magnitude as a wave of electric cars hits the streets in five years. “With electrification there’s going to be a lot of pressure not only to build infrastructure, but also to help consumers get over the range anxiety they feel,” Fasihuddin told Reuters. “We think FreeWire is attacking that problem is a good way.” Fasihuddin said Volvo’s investment would allow it to play an influential role in designing products with FreeWire and to work with BP, which invested $5 million in FreeWire in January. “If you look at the possibility of piloting an innovation, (BP’s involvement) just makes it all the more possible because we get to utilize our and BP’s retail networks and that gives us a bigger, global sandbox to play in,” Fasihuddin said.

138,"PARIS — Naomi Osaka screamed, “Oh, my God!” after one shanked shot. She mouthed something and clasped her hands together, as if praying, after another. There were plenty of deep sighs and exaggerated eye rolls, too. The No. 1-seeded Osaka got off to a terrible start at the French Open again, never masking her frustration. After some slip-ups near the end, Osaka also prevailed again, displaying the grit and the groundstrokes that just won’t let her lose during what has become a 16-match Grand Slam winning streak. Osaka trailed by a set and a break on Thursday against the former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in the second round at Roland Garros before coming back to win an entertaining matchup, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, and prolong her bid for a third consecutive major championship. “I have this mind-set that I feel like I can win if it gets down to the wire,” Osaka said. “Like, if I have to break a person, I feel like I have the ability to do that. So I probably shouldn’t wait until the last minute.” [French Open scoreboard: Men’s singles | Women’s singles] In the first round, Osaka not only dropped the opening set but did so by a 6-0 score. This time, Osaka ceded the first four games against Azarenka and was responsible for their match’s first seven unforced errors. “Technically, like, she kind of killed me in the first set,” Osaka said, “and I just kept trying to find a way to stay positive.” The defending champion Simona Halep required that same sort of resolve to get through her own test, squandering a big second-set lead and three match points before holding on to beat 87th-ranked Magda Linette, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3. Halep, who said afterward that she felt a “little bit sick” and planned to “sleep all day tomorrow,” was up a set and 5-3 in the second before dropping four games in a row and being broken twice while serving for the match. Neither Osaka nor Halep managed to put on the sort of solid performance delivered by Serena Williams, who was barely bothered during a 6-3, 6-2 victory over the qualifier Kurumi Nara, or the top-seeded man, Novak Djokovic, who beat Henri Laaksonen, 6-1, 6-4, 6-3. Azarenka sought to control points with deep, attacking strokes and by going after Osaka’s backhand side. “I played very smart; I really played the right spots,” Azarenka said. “I was doing everything that I was supposed to do. And, especially, moving well and pushing her back.” Azarenka knows a thing or two about how to perform on the sport’s biggest stages. She won two titles at the Australian Open, reached two finals at the United States Open and was a semifinalist at Wimbledon and the French Open. She is currently ranked 43rd, though, because of time she missed over the past few seasons while pregnant and then dealing with a custody issue involving her son. So what, in terms of talent and tenacity, could have passed for a late-in-the-proceedings showdown at a major was held, instead, in Week 1. When Azarenka sprinted for a cross-court forehand winner that closed a 15-stroke exchange, she took a 4-2 lead in the second set after 77 minutes. She and Osaka played for more than an hour and a half after that, and Azarenka certainly had opportunities to edge even further ahead, including once when she had a break point to go up by 5-2 and serve for the victory but netted a forehand. Or the three times she was one point from leading by 5-3 but was broken there with her second double-fault of the game. Azarenka’s serve faltered down the stretch, and Osaka’s top-notch returning contributed to a key stretch in which she grabbed 9 of 11 games. “She has, obviously, a lot of confidence,” Azarenka said. Which Osaka should, of course, given that she won the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January and is trying to become the first woman in tennis history to collect her first three Slam trophies in a row. “Today I kind of felt like a challenger,” she said. “Like, I know she went to the semis here before, so obviously she has a lot more experience here,” said Osaka, 21, who has never been past the third round in Paris but is 9-1 on clay in 2019 after entering the season with a 9-11 mark on the slow surface. “She won Grand Slams, and she was No. 1 way before I was. I’m still kind of new at this.” Dominic Thiem, the No. 4 seed in the men’s draw, overcame some trickery from Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan and advanced to the third round with a 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-3, 7-5 victory. Bublik surprised Thiem with an underhand serve in the first set and frustrated him with a series of drop shots, spins and volleys. But Thiem, a finalist last year at Roland Garros, recovered from a break of serve in the fourth set and then gave Bublik a taste of his own medicine on his first match point, producing a well-disguised — and successful — drop shot. Thiem will next face Pablo Cuevas, another master of trick shots. Cuevas was leading, 7-6 (3), 6-3, 2-1, when Kyle Edmund retired from their match because of a left knee injury. Eighth-seeded Juan Martín del Potro was also challenged, requiring nearly four hours to get by Yoshihito Nishioka, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-2. The American teenager Amanda Anisimova pulled off an upset, defeating 11th-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, 6-4, 6-2. Anisimova, 17, also eliminated Sabalenka from the Australian Open, in the third round. Another teenager, Iga Swiatek, who turns 18 on Friday, knocked out 16th-seeded Wang Qiang, 6-3, 6-0, in under an hour to reach the third round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time."

140,"Google’s new Daydream View VR headset is available starting today, and the fabric-encased, lightweight plastic Cardboard successor is a big step up, not only from Google’s first modest attempts at creating a VR headset, but also for mobile virtual reality in general. When Google debuted Cardboard at its 2014 Developers Conference, then- Google Product Chief Sundar Pichai showed off the headset made of modest materials with an insouciance that indirectly poked fun at the ambitious and expensive Oculus purchase Facebook had announced only shortly before. Google’s VR headset was made of about $10 worth of materials, and while many dismissed it as a toy compared to other VR hardware, it ended up providing a lot of guidance for Daydream, which is easily the new leader in casual, mobile VR. The basic premise for Daydream View is the same: All you have to do is slide your phone in and go. Google’s bottom-up approach to VR was seen as far too casual by many, but I predicted at the time that the company’s low-end look at VR would be the only truly competitive alternative to high-end offerings like the Rift. Middle ground for virtual reality is hard to find, because trade-offs for costs in the mid-range can’t make up for the huge drop-offs in overall experience. Cardboard succeeded precisely because it wasn’t really promising anything, and it basically didn’t cost anything, either. Daydream View’s price tag might boost experience expectations somewhat, but it’s still only $79 in the U.S., which is $20 less than its nearest competitor, the Samsung Gear VR. And while the higher price tag might mean people expect more, Daydream View will over deliver on the expectations of most. Daydream View is still VR’s most low-friction access point; it’s actually easier to use than Cardboard, because of the built-in head strap and bundled Bluetooth controller. But the quality of its VR experience is at least on par with Gear VR – and based on the time I’ve spent with it so far, it’s better, thanks to a more sensible VR hub and navigation elements that build on user familiarity with Android and the Play Store. Getting it working with your phone, at least with the Pixel XL review unit provided with the Daydream View by Google, is also far easier than starting out with Gear VR, mainly because there are no cables or physical connections to make. You fold down the View’s front flap, place the Daydream-compatible phone in the headset and close it back up. You don’t even need to be careful about aligning the screen image – it detects its position and auto-aligns for a clear view through the headsets lenses. It’s a lower barrier to entry than the easiest home VR experience, which is PlayStation VR, and the bundled controller works very well for making sure there’s no confusion about how to navigate once you’re immersed. Gear VR’s gamepad support is appreciated, but out of the box, you awkwardly navigate using a touch panel on the side of the headset, which has never felt like a natural interaction mode. The library of Daydream content is a little thin in terms of titles available at launch, especially compared to the decent size of Gear VR’s available options. But Google appears to have selected for quality in terms of both first- and third-party software offerings, and the terrific native support for YouTube 360-degree videos means there’s no shortage of casual content to consume. The list of apps with upcoming Daydream support also offers a lot to look forward to in terms of things that could bring in users who aren’t sure about VR but want to get into it via familiar experiences – Netflix and HBO Go should really help, for instance. Google made a big deal about the design of Daydream View, from tis fabric exterior to its single strap design and light weight, and while it’s still definitely going to draw stares when you’re using it on an airplane or the bus, for instance, what they’ve done in terms of making it appear more generally palatable shouldn’t be underestimated. In the end, Daydream View feels like a next step, not the culminating arrival point for consumer VR. But it progresses the field in a number of very important ways – ways that mean Daydream VR is likely to be the first VR experience for significant number of mobile users, who luckily won’t be disappointed by what they find. Early VR hype gave way to realities that indicated its niche status wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon – Rift and Vive are too specialized, too expensive and too power-hungry to work with anything resembling a general audience. Latecomers have done more to convince me there’s real potential in the consumer VR market; PSVR is a seriously piece of kit for anyone who enjoys gaming, and Daydream View has the potential to impress everyday mobile users in a way nothing else out there today can hope to achieve."
141,"Recently, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Richard CordrayRichard Adams CordrayWatchdog agency must pick a side: Consumers or scammers Kraninger's CFPB gives consumers the tools to help themselves House rebukes Mulvaney's efforts to rein in consumer bureau MORE falsely claimed in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee that people in the 14 U.S. states that do not provide small-dollar lending “seem to get by just fine.” Director Cordray’s statement, and the CFPB’s own actions, again prove that the bureau prefers its ideologically-driven activist agenda to facts. Independent data and academic research have repeatedly disproven the myth that consumers living in states without small-dollar lending are better off. In fact, data and research have repeatedly shown that American consumers value their access to small-dollar loans and face worse financial prospects when small-dollar loans are not available.  A 2007 staff study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that in certain states that banned small-dollar loans, consumers “bounced more checks, complained more about lenders and debt collectors, and have filed for Chapter 7... bankruptcy at a higher rate.”   A separate study by a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City found that limiting access to small-dollar loans leaves consumers with fewer credit options, can hurt consumers’ credit standings and leads to consumers settling for inferior products. The study noted that small-dollar loans can be a sensible and less costly credit option for underserved and underbanked communities.  Just last month, a survey of small-dollar loan customers conducted by KRC Research found that a new small-dollar lending ban in South Dakota will severely restrict customers’ access to small-dollar credit. In fact, 66 percent of respondents believe they will be negatively affected by the law. The data also found that more than half of the customers surveyed who were unable to obtain small-dollar loans were forced to pay late fees or not pay their bills at all. A significant proportion of these customers also bounced checks or used overdraft protection through their bank or credit union, mirroring earlier findings. The research shows that limiting access to small-dollar loans can and will have a disastrous impact on individuals' financial well-being. Tellingly, the same day Director Cordray made his ill-considered claim that consumers in the states that ban small-dollar loans “seem to get by just fine,” at least 11,600 consumers in the 14 states without small-dollar loans went online to seek such loans, according to data my organization, the Community Financial Services Association of America, received directly from the non-prime credit bureau Clarity Services Inc. Further data from this company show that in the fourth quarter of 2016, an estimated 2.7 million small-dollar loan applications were submitted online from residents in these 14 states. Even the CFPB itself repudiates Director Cordray’s claim. Nearly one-third of consumer complaints that the CFPB has received into its complaint portal about small-dollar lending come from residents of the 14 states without legal, licensed lending, thus proving that bans do not remove small-dollar loans from the marketplace. In fact, all these bans do is remove state regulations and consumer protections. The CFPB wants to eliminate small-dollar lending nationwide without addressing the issue of illegal, unlicensed lenders at all.  The CFPB and its allies ignore research and data that show the consequence of their agenda on consumers who are in legitimate need of access to credit. Cordray’s claim parallels Pew Advocacy’s recent survey that attempts to delegitimize small-dollar loans through skewed and flawed methodology. The bureau attempts to peddle its agenda without any understanding of, or attention to, the data, marketplace, financial options, or concerns of consumers who use small-dollar loans. While they argue that borrowers have access to an array of financial products, such as those offered by banks or credit unions, the reality is that consumers are largely shut out of the traditional financial system.  The CFPB and its allies could work constructively to find ways to protect consumers while preserving options and access to credit. Following the complaint data, for example, they could seek to create a registry of legal and licensed small-dollar lenders to help combat illegal, unlicensed lenders — who make up one-third of its complaints — and protect consumers. This is a measure my organization has supported for years, but which the CFPB and its allies have ignored.  Instead, they persist in a misguided effort to outlaw the entire small-dollar lending industry. Their ignorance of the facts and efforts to perpetuate the myth that people “seem to get by just fine” when access to small-dollar loans is restricted is a short-sighted and dangerous assumption that has been repeatedly disproven. Demand for credit will exist whether or not small-dollar loans are available in any given jurisdiction. Removing consumers’ access to legal, licensed small-dollar loans will only exacerbate the financial struggles of millions of Americans.

142,"Researchers found that deaths caused by heat waves in India more than doubled after the country's temperature increased by nearly one degree Fahrenheit since 1960, the New York Times reports. The study suggested that ""future climate warming will lead to substantial increases in heat-related mortality"" in other developing countries like India, where ""populations are especially vulnerable"" to extreme temperatures. Why it matters: The 2015 Paris climate accord, from which President Trump recently withdrew the United States, aimed to limit global temperature increase to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by reducing emissions around the globe. This new study revealed that India's 0.9 degree Fahrenheit increase in 50 years raised the probability of a heat wave with over 100 deaths from 13% to 32%. Experts ""expect India's temperature to rise by four to 10 degrees"" by the end of this century."
143,"IT WAS THE day the temperature reached a French all-time record of 45.9°C (114.6°F). At the station in the sleepy Provençal town of Orange, a high-speed TGV train was being held indefinitely due to forest fires farther down the track, and passengers were wilting in the stifling heat. So the station master mobilised a human chain to shift box after box of bottled water from his store room to the train. The scene captured many of the contradictions France faces, as the land of plastic bottled water tries both to go green and stay cool. Ever since Emmanuel Macron vowed in 2017 to “make our planet great again”, France has sought to take the lead in greenery. The president uses respect for the Paris climate deal of 2015 as a tool of foreign policy. In Brune Poirson he has an energetic junior environment minister who seems to be off every week fishing plastic bags out of the sea or sifting through recycled waste. The government has just banned all disposable plastic in government offices from next January. A French commitment to be carbon-neutral by 2050 is going through parliament. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Yet the country is not quite as green as it would like to think. France’s environmental council, set up by Mr Macron, recently declared that the reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions between 2015 and 2018 failed to meet government targets. Mr Macron himself cancelled a rise in the carbon tax on motor fuel after mass gilets jaunes protests. Ms Poirson, who implores her fellow citizens to embrace le recyclage, concedes that “France is behind in terms of recycling waste.” The country recycles plenty of glass bottles and paper, but only 26% of plastic packaging, below the EU average. Part of the problem is the sheer volume of water consumed. No French supermarket trolley reaches the till without a six-pack of litre bottles, wrapped in yet more plastic film. After the Italians and Germans, the French are Europe’s biggest consumers of bottled water. Danone, a French firm, is the world’s second-biggest supplier of bottled water, selling a dozen brands. Under pressure, Danone now promises to make 100% of its packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. This would help, as long as consumers carry out le recyclage. By the end of the hottest day in French history, rubbish bins on streets and station platforms overflowed with empty plastic bottles—awaiting their probable fate as landfill."

146,"MUMBAI, India — On the whole, India’s censor board was fine with the gritty film “Udta Punjab,” or “Flying Punjab,” about the wave of heroin addiction washing over that north Indian state. There were just a few things to address — like removing every reference to Punjab, including the word in the movie’s title and a signpost shown in an opening sequence, so that viewers left the theater believing they had seen a movie set in a fictitious land. This, even though Punjab’s drug problem is no secret, having been widely reported in recent years. And eliminating references to the cities of Jalandhar, Chandigarh and Amritsar, as well as the word “election,” close-ups of drug injections and the name of a dog in the film, Jacky Chain. In all, the head of the censor board, Pahlaj Nihalani, demanded 94 cuts to the film before it could be released to theaters as scheduled on June 17, the film’s producer, Anurag Kashyap, said on Twitter. Mr. Kashyap has challenged the board’s order before the Bombay High Court, while also seeking financial relief for the delay in certification, which seems very likely to postpone the film’s opening until at least July. The court, after a hearing on Thursday, adjourned the case until Friday. Movies regularly come under the Indian censor board’s knife, sometimes for baffling reasons. Last year, the agency cut in half the length of a kiss in the latest James Bond film, “Spectre.” Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine” went unreleased when Mr. Allen refused to comply with the board’s demand that a smoking disclaimer appear on screen every time someone lit a cigarette. In the case of “Flying Punjab,” the board’s critics say politics seemed to play a role. Punjab is governed by the regional political party Akali Dal, which has long been accused by its opponents of turning a blind eye to the state’s pervasive drug mafia and, presumably, is not eager to have viewers — and voters — reminded of the issue of heroin use in the state. Akali Dal is an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party and of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who appointed Mr. Nihalani. On the other side, Mr. Nihalani recently accused Mr. Kashyap of taking funds from the Aam Aadmi Party, which hopes to unseat Akali Dal in coming elections. Mr. Kashyap denied the accusation. Incensed by this allegation, a group of prominent writers and directors has joined the cast and crew of “Flying Punjab” in calling for Mr. Nihalani to be fired. Among those who spoke at a news conference this week were Zoya Akhtar, the director and screenwriter, and Mahesh Bhatt, a National Film Award-winning director, screenwriter and producer. “The board is meant to provide a certificate, not censor or cut our films,” Mr. Kashyap said at the briefing. “Let the audience decide what they want to reject. How can one person become the moral guardian?” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Aamir Khan. Although he has spoken out in support of the film, he was not in fact among those who defended it at a news conference this week in Mumbai."

151,"The bulls have history on their side, according to Oppenheimer technical analyst Ari Wald. Just as the markets saw their share of ups and downs this week, future expected market volatility, as measured by the VIX, has gone through the same. The VIX hit its highest level in almost three months on Tuesday and the index has surged more than 30 percent since last Wednesday. While that would generally be taken as a sign of rising investor anxiety, for Oppenheimer technician Ari Wald, ""this volatility is marking an opportunity to buy stocks. "" Wald looks back to the history books to point out something that he sees repeating again. ""Since 1990, we've found that when the VIX spikes 50 percent and the S&P is in an uptrend, [for] the next six months, the S&P averages 8 percent gain versus an only 4 percent gain during any six-month period,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" Wald's chart shows that such a trend actually happened this year. Volatility spiked near the end of 2015 while the S&P 500 was on the rise. Though stocks did fall in February of this year, the S&P ultimately rose more than 10 percent from January to the end of June. On a long-term chart of the S&P 500 versus the VIX, Wald shows that the S&P 500 recently broke through resistance, a breakout that coincided with a spike in the VIX. In other words, Wald believes that a short-term market rally is in the works, and investors may want to cash in. Oppenheimer has a year-end target for the S&P 500 of 2,250, meaning that they believe the market could rise almost 5 percent."
152,"ONE of my most painful memories, from an otherwise happy day, comes from the autumn of 2005. My wife was labouring with our first child, and I had driven her to the Royal Free Hospital in London. There was, as usual, a slow-moving queue for the car park. Sitting in a reclining position is painful when you are in labour, so my wife got out of the car and went to lean against a railing. Behind us, drivers started hooting impatiently. If somebody had at that moment offered me a parking space, I would gladly have taken it, no matter what the cost. Which helps to explain why Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal to abolish parking charges in English hospitals is such a lousy idea. Even by the low standards set by the Labour Party under Mr Corbyn’s leadership, the policy is economically illiterate. If enacted, it would surely harm patients. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Free parking is not generally thought of as a birthright in Britain—as it is in most of America, for example. If you drive to a British cinema, swimming pool or restaurant, you are likely to have to pay to store your car. Many residential streets are metered or reserved for local residents. Unlike in America and Asia, British cities seldom force developers to build large car parks around their buildings. After all, goes the thinking, a plentiful supply of free parking just encourages people to drive. The point of charging for parking is to control demand and avoid a commons tragedy, in which a finite resource is over-exploited to everyone’s detriment. Ideally, parking would be priced so that about one in ten spaces is unoccupied at any given time: that way, everybody who is prepared to pay for a space will quickly be able to find one. This is roughly what commercial multi-storey parking garages try to achieve, and it is also what some hospitals do. The Royal Free hospital currently charges £3 ($3.90) an hour for parking. Of course everybody wants to be able to park cheaply or for nothing. But when parking is in short supply, the alternative to paid parking is not really free parking; it is often no parking at all. If English hospitals stopped charging, the car parks would quickly fill up—something that has happened even in relatively uncrowded Scotland, where hospitals do not normally charge. More visitors and staff would drive. And what would stop people from dropping off their cars at the hospital and popping round the corner for a bit of shopping? If English hospitals were to abolish parking charges they would instantly give themselves a commons problem. This would have ugly consequences. It is bad enough when cinemas under-price parking, and you miss the first 15 minutes of “Guardians of the Galaxy 2” because you are cruising for a space. If a hospital in a crowded city stopped charging, it would mean more frail, elderly people staggering into the accident and emergency ward on their own as their sons and daughters search for a space, more parents panicking as a child who has hit her head lolls in the back seat, and more labouring women leaning against railings. Anybody who votes Labour because he likes the sound of Mr Corbyn’s proposal had better hope he never needs his head examined."
153,"The Federal Reserve said Thursday that close to three dozen of the largest U.S. banks passed annual stress tests designed to test their ability to survive an array of economic crises. All 35 bank-holding companies subject to annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests proved that they held enough capital and developed sufficient plans to weather hypothetical financial shocks and recessions modeled by the Fed, the central bank announced Thursday. ""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Fed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement. The Fed began stress-testing banks in 2009, two years after the start of the financial crisis that triggered the 2008 recession.  Dodd-Frank, the strict financial reform law enacted by former President Obama in 2010, ordered the Fed to issue annual stress tests to all U.S. bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets. A bipartisan bill signed by President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE last month raised that threshold to $100 billion. The Fed said it would not release the stress test results of three banks that would have originally been included in the 2018 cycle, but now fall below the $100 billion threshold: CIT Group Inc., Comerica Incorporated, and Zions Bancorporation. Banks subject to this year’s stress tests were graded on their ability to respond to three levels of hypothetical economic downturns.  The most extreme situation, called the “severely adverse scenario,” judged banks on how they could handle a severe global recession with the U.S. unemployment rate rising to 10 percent, a nearly 6-percent increase from its current level, and a steepening Treasury yield curve. The Treasury yield curve tracks interest rates on U.S. federal bonds by maturation date. Economists consider higher long-term Treasury yields to reflect a strengthening economy, while higher rates for short-term bonds are seen as a troubling sign. The Fed said that the 2018 severely adverse scenario is the most challenging situation used by the central bank in stress tests. Banks above the $100 billion threshold are also subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which determines their ability to fund dividend payments and share buybacks amid economic crises. The Fed is scheduled to release those results next Thursday. View the discussion thread.

154,"BEIJING, Oct 26 (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd reported a 38 percent drop in third-quarter net profit on Friday, dragged down by a weakening yuan and rising fuel and debt costs. While Chinese airlines have seen revenue surge in tandem with growing travel demand, their costs have been recently by rebounding oil prices and a volatile currency. China Eastern - the country’s second-largest carrier by passenger numbers - said net profit attributable to shareholders dropped to 2.2 billion yuan ($317 million) in the July-to-September period, from 3.6 billion yuan a year earlier, although revenue rose 13.5 percent to 33.5 billion yuan. For the first nine months of the year, net profit was down 43.3 percent from a year earlier to 4.5 billion yuan. The yuan has fallen by about 6 percent against the U.S. dollar since the start of this year, pushing up financing costs at airlines which have bought planes with mainly U.S. dollar-denominated loans. China Eastern reported 2.2 billion yuan in foreign exchange losses for the first three quarters, as the Chinese currency depreciated against the dollar. The airline said in a separate announcement that it plans to issue up to 15.4 billion yuan in corporate bonds to fund aircraft purchases and replenish working capital. In July, China Eastern announced that it would raise up to $2.23 billion in a share sale to expand its fleet and to replenish working capital. Shanghai-based Juneyao Airlines Co Ltd invested in the state carrier as part of the deal. ($1 = 6.9446 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Stella Qiu and Brenda Goh; Editing by Christopher

156,"Learning any new subject can be challenging — for many students, that subject is math. Fortunately, Photomath is here to help. Photomath, a finalist in the Startup Battlefield at Disrupt Europe 2014, is an app that solves complex math problems using your smartphone’s camera. Since Disrupt, Photomath founder and CEO Damir Sabol tells TechCrunch that the app has been downloaded over 36 million times on Android and iOS, and is consistently one of the top 5 educational apps in the U.S. This week, Photomath released version 3.0 of its popular app on the iOS app store, bringing a major new update that should make it even easier for iOS users to solve math problems. The app previously was only able to read printed text, i.e. from textbooks; however, the new app now instantly recognizes handwriting, so users can write out problems and have Photomath solve them by simply pointing their camera at the paper. The update also brings a new math expert system, Photomath+, that solves problems similarly to how a human would, and walks users through how to solve the problem themselves with a colorful and useful step-by-step guide. This system seems to address the tension between having an app do your homework versus having an app help you learn. The Photomath+ service is free through November 30, but will cost a premium after that time. Sabol tells us the company is still finalizing the pricing and subscription model for Photomath+, and more details on the price will be available later this year. The app’s core services, like solving problems with a camera, will stay free forever. These new features are available for iOS now, and will be coming to Android by the end of the month. You can download the Photomath app for iOS or for Android. We’re thrilled to see a former Battlefield finalist doing so well post-Disrupt, and we can’t wait to see the next batch of Battlefield companies at Disrupt London 2016. Battlefield applications for Disrupt London are now open, so if you’re interested in partaking in the Battlefield and meet the eligibility criteria, you can apply to the Battlefield here. Disrupt London 2016 takes place December 5-6 at London’s Copper Box Arena. We hope to see you all there."
157,"Tax cuts, spending increases and higher interest rates could make it harder to respond to future recessions and deal with other needs. The federal government could soon pay more in interest on its debt than it spends on the military, Medicaid or children’s programs. The run-up in borrowing costs is a one-two punch brought on by the need to finance a fast-growing budget deficit, worsened by tax cuts and steadily rising interest rates that will make the debt more expensive. With less money coming in and more going toward interest, political leaders will find it harder to address pressing needs like fixing crumbling roads and bridges or to make emergency moves like pulling the economy out of future recessions. Within a decade, more than $900 billion in interest payments will be due annually, easily outpacing spending on myriad other programs. Already the fastest-growing major government expense, the cost of interest is on track to hit $390 billion next year, nearly 50 percent more than in 2017, according to the Congressional Budget Office. “It’s very much something to worry about,” said C. Eugene Steuerle, a fellow at the Urban Institute and a co-founder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington. “Everything else is getting squeezed.” Gradually rising interest rates would have made borrowing more expensive even without additional debt. But the tax cuts passed late last year have created a deeper hole, with the deficit increasing faster than expected. A budget bill approved in February that raised spending by $300 billion over two years will add to the financial pressure. The deficit is expected to total nearly $1 trillion next year — the first time it has been that big since 2012, when the economy was still struggling to recover from the financial crisis and interest rates were near zero. Annual interest payments on the national debt are expected to triple over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. $915 billion Interest payments on the national debt $900 billion 600 300 $263 billion 0 ’17 ’18 ’19 ’20 ’21 ’22 ’23 ’24 ’25 ’26 ’27 ’28 Interest payments on the national debt $900 billion $915 billion 600 300 $263 billion 0 ’17 ’18 ’19 ’20 ’21 ’22 ’23 ’24 ’25 ’26 ’27 ’28 By The New York Times | Source: Congressional Budget Office Deficit hawks have gone silent, even proposing changes that would exacerbate the deficit. House Republicans introduced legislation this month that would make the tax cuts permanent. “The issue has just disappeared,” said Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat. “There’s collective amnesia.” The combination, say economists, marks a journey into mostly uncharted financial territory. In the past, government borrowing expanded during recessions and waned in recoveries. That countercyclical policy has been a part of the standard Keynesian toolbox to combat downturns since the Great Depression. The deficit is soaring now as the economy booms, meaning the stimulus is pro-cyclical. The risk is that the government would have less room to maneuver if the economy slows. Debt as a percentage of gross domestic product tends to increase during recessions and fall during recoveries. But the debt is increasing now, even as the economy is growing, because of tax cuts and spending increases.

Pouring gasoline on an already hot economy has resulted in faster growth — the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter. But Mr. Frankel warns that when the economy weakens, the government will find it more difficult to cut taxes or increase spending. Lawmakers might, in fact, feel compelled to cut spending as tax revenue falls, further depressing the economy. “There will eventually be another recession, and this increases the chances we will have to slam on the brakes when the car is already going too slowly,” Mr. Frankel said. Interest payments will make up 13 percent of the federal budget a decade from now, surpassing spending on Medicaid and defense.

In a decade, interest on the debt will eat up 13 percent of government spending, up from 6.6 percent in 2017. “By 2020, we will spend more on interest than we do on kids, including education, food stamps and aid to families,” said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a research and advocacy organization. Interest costs already dwarf spending on many popular programs. For example, grants to students from low-income families for college total roughly $30 billion — about one-tenth of what the government will pay in interest this year. Interest payments will overtake Medicaid in 2020 and the Department of Defense budget in 2023. What’s more, the heavy burden of interest payments could make it harder for the government to repair aging infrastructure or take on other big new projects. Mr. Trump has called for spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, but Congress has not taken up that idea. Until recently, ultralow interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve to support the economy, allowed lawmakers to borrow without fretting too much about the cost of that debt. But as the economy has strengthened, the Fed has gradually raised rates, starting in December 2015. The central bank is expected to push rates up again on Wednesday, and more increases are in store. “When rates went down to record lows, it allowed the government to take on more debt without paying more interest,” Mr. Goldwein said. “That party is ending.” After bottoming out below 2 percent, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has climbed to over 3 percent recently. Yield on 10-year Treasury note 8 % MONTHLY RECESSIONS 6 4 2 0 ’98 ’00 ’02 ’04 ’06 ’08 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 Yield on 10-year Treasury note 8 % MONTHLY RECESSIONS 6 4 2 0 ’98 ’02 ’06 ’10 ’14 ’18 By The New York Times | Source: Reuters Since the beginning of the year, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen by more than half a percentage point, to 3.1 percent. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the yield will climb to 4.2 percent in 2021. Given that the total public debt of the United States stands at nearly $16 trillion, even a small uptick in rates can cost the government billions. There’s no guarantee that these forecasts will prove accurate. If the economy weakens, rates might fall or rise only slightly, reducing interest payments. But rates could also overshoot the budget office forecast. Some members of Congress want to set the stage for even more red ink. Republicans in the House want to make last year’s tax cuts permanent, instead of letting some of them expire at the end of 2025. That would reduce federal revenue by an additional $631 billion over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center. The dollar has strengthened even as government borrowing has increased.

But most experts say that isn’t likely because the dollar is the world’s reserve currency. As a result, the United States still has plenty of borrowing capacity left because the Fed can print money with fewer consequences than other central banks. And interest rates plunged over the last decade, even as the government turned to the market for trillions each year after the recession. That’s because Treasury bonds are still the favored port of international investors in any economic storm. “We exported a financial crisis a decade ago, and the world responded by sending us money,” said William G. Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. But that privileged position has allowed politicians in both parties to avoid politically painful steps like cutting spending or raising taxes. That doesn’t mean rapidly rising interest costs and a bigger deficit won’t eventually catch up with us. Charles Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter administration, once summed up the danger of deficits with a metaphor. “It’s not so much a question of the wolf at the door, but termites in the woodwork.” Rather than simply splitting along party lines, lawmakers’ attitudes toward the deficit also depend on which party is in power. Republicans pilloried the Obama administration for proposing a large stimulus in the depths of the recession in 2009 and complained about the deficit for years. In 2013, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called the debt and deficit “the transcendent issue of our era.” By 2017, as Senate majority leader, he quickly shepherded the tax cut through Congress. Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who warned of the deficit’s dangers in the past, nevertheless played down that threat on the Senate floor as the tax billed neared passage. “I understand it’s a risk, but I think it’s an appropriate risk to be able to say let’s allow Americans to keep more of their own money to invest in this economy,” he said. He also claimed the tax cuts would pay for themselves even as the Congressional Budget Office estimated that they would add $250 billion to the deficit on average from 2019 to 2024. In an interview, Mr. Lankford insisted that the jury was still out on whether the tax cuts would generate additional revenue, citing the strong economic growth recently. While the Republican about-face has been much more striking, Democrats have adjusted their position, too. Mr. Warner, the Virginia Democrat, called last year’s tax bill “the worst piece of legislation we have passed since I arrived in the Senate.” In 2009, however, when Congress passed an $800 billion stimulus bill backed by the Obama administration, he called it “a responsible mix of tax cuts and investments that will create jobs.” The difference, Mr. Warner said, was that the economy was near the precipice then. “There was virtual unanimity among economists that we needed a stimulus,” he said. “But a $2 trillion tax cut at the end of a business cycle with borrowed money won’t end well.”"

160,"U.S. congressional candidates hammered into the homestretch of a bruising campaign season on Saturday, with Democrats focused on protecting a 2010 healthcare law while President Donald Trump touted economic growth and sounded dire warnings on immigration. Control of both houses of the U.S. Congress, currently dominated by Republicans, and 36 governors' offices will be at stake when Americans vote in Tuesday's elections. Interest has been unusually high for a non-presidential election year, with early voting running well ahead of past cycles. Opinion polls and nonpartisan forecasters generally show Democrats with a strong chance of taking the 23 additional seats they would need for a majority in the House of Representatives, which they could use to launch investigations into Trump's administration and block his legislative agenda. Republicans are favored to retain control of the Senate, whose powers include confirming Trump's nominations to lifetime seats on the Supreme Court. Trump was due to campaign with Senate candidates in Montana and Florida, on the fourth day of an 11-rally tour largely focused on states he carried in 2016, where Republican challengers are trying to unseat Democratic incumbents. ""Heading to Montana and Florida today! Everyone is excited about the Jobs Numbers - 250,000 new jobs in October. Also, wages rising. Wow!"" Trump said on Twitter early Saturday. The Labor Department on Friday reported sharply better-than-expected job creation in October, with the unemployment rate steady at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent and wages notching their best annual gain in almost a decade. Republicans in many competitive suburban districts have tried to focus their campaign messages on the robust economic growth, though in his campaign appearances Trump has also focused on his hard-line immigration stance as he looks to stem the illegal and legal flow of people into the United States. Congressional candidates campaigned in a whirlwind close across the country: in Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton greeted voters in the Manassas Veterans Day parade; in New Jersey Republican Jay Webber met them in a diner, and in Minnesota Republican Pete Stauber went door to door urging people to vote. As of Friday night, almost 32.4 million people had cast ballots early, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks turnout. That is up more than 50 percent from the 20.5 million early votes cast in all of 2014, the last federal election when the White House was not at stake. Trump on Friday appeared in West Virginia with Patrick Morrisey, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. That marked his third campaign appearance in that state. His Saturday visit to Belgrade, Montana, to pump up the campaign of Matt Rosendale, the Republican state auditor challenging Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester, will be his fourth to Montana. Some analysts said the president's repeated visits to states that he won in 2016 were a signal Republicans were worried about keeping control of Congress. ""It's not a good sign for Republicans if they have to spend all these resources for a seat they shouldn't have to be fighting for,"" said Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at West Virginia University, in a phone interview. ""That should be a solid Republican seat."" In Florida, Trump is due to campaign for Governor Rick Scott, who is trying to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, and U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor against Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum. Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, on Friday campaigned with the Florida Democrats, telling voters that only his party would defend the 2010 healthcare law that was his signature domestic achievement. The still-energetic but visibly graying 57-year-old former president also warned against the politics of fear and criticized dishonesty in campaigning - comments directed at Trump, though Obama did not name him. ""We all - we all try to put a positive spin on things. But what we have not seen, the way we're seeing right now, is politicians just blatantly, repeatedly, baldly ... shamelessly lie,"" Obama said. ""Just making stuff up. That's what they're doing right now, all the time."""
161,"The spotlight is back on FBI Director James Comey thanks to Michael Flynn’s resignation as national security adviser. Comey, whom Democratic nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonTop Sanders adviser: Warren isn't competing for 'same pool of voters' Anti-Trump vets join Steyer group in pressing Democrats to impeach Trump Republicans plot comeback in New Jersey MORE’s campaign blamed for her loss in last year’s presidential election, is now reportedly presiding over an investigation that appears to have implicated one of President Trump’s top aides. Republicans and Democrats alike are watching closely, putting pressure on the bureau for a public accounting. Democrats want to know exactly what Flynn said to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak — and on whose orders — amid ongoing scrutiny into a widespread influence campaign by Moscow intended to help install Trump in the White House. “The much bigger issue is, what is the connection with Russia and the Trump administration? It’s not only how far up does it go — was the campaign in collusion?” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). Republicans have been more muted about a probe into a Republican president and instead have attempted to shift focus to the wiretap that reportedly exposed Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak to the FBI — and the subsequent press leaks that revealed the wiretaps. “I expect for the FBI to tell me what is going on, and they better have a good answer,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who was a member of the Trump transition team executive committee, told The Washington Post. “The big problem I see here is that you have an American citizen who had his phone calls recorded,” said Nunes, who announced Tuesday that his committee would probe the leaks. Comey was perhaps the most controversial figure in Washington in the weeks surrounding the 2016 election — but he has been conspicuously quiet since Nov. 8, both on and off the Hill. Democrats blamed Comey for costing Clinton the White House after he announced the FBI was looking at new information related to her use of a private email server just a little more than a week before Election Day. Days before the election, Comey said the FBI had found no information to change its earlier decision. But Republicans have also expressed displeasure with Comey. He won GOP ire when over the summer he announced the FBI would not be recommending any charges against Clinton. Comey’s presence has been in the background in recent weeks. The FBI director briefed Trump about Russia’s involvement in the election in early January at a meeting at Trump Tower. During the meeting, Comey also let Trump know of a dossier of memos prepared by a former British spy for political rivals to Trump. The memos included claims that Russia was seeking information that could be used as leverage against Trump. Trump in late January reportedly decided to keep Comey on as FBI director. The decision ensured that Comey, a Republican, would be involved in any probes of Trump related to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Flynn’s activities — which also include a paid speech he gave in Moscow in 2015 — will almost certainly be examined by the FBI. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that the FBI interviewed Flynn in the first days of the Trump administration. Following a deeply contentious classified briefing on the Hill in January, furious Democrats accused Comey of a double standard — and in some cases, called for his removal. Asked if he had faith in the FBI to conduct the reported Russia investigation in good faith, Nadler on Tuesday answered: “I don’t know.” Lawmakers are divided on whether they believe that Comey set his own precedent with the Clinton disclosures and will therefore be forced to go public with details of the Russia probe. “He twice made the decision that in light of the high public awareness, to try to clear the air — and no air got cleared,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said. “I’m not going to disagree that he will live by that experience of, no matter what his reasons, it did not advance the trust in the FBI when he was honest and forthcoming.” But Comey has long been known as a maverick — he has described himself as “tone deaf” to politics. Facing down fierce demands from Democrats to confirm the Russia probe in January, he was described as unflinching and defiant. “I have a sense that the man is trying to do what he thinks is right — because he has made everyone mad. To me, that’s a sign of a guy who really believes he is trying to affect his office in a way commensurate with his oath,” said Rep.

163,"European markets finished Monday on a positive note after oil prices staged a strong comeback, posting gains of as much as 3 percent during trade. The pan-European STOXX 600 ended trade up 0.69 percent provisionally. All sectors closed in positive territory, with the exception of travel and leisure. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 finished up 0.75 percent, the French CAC 40 popped 1.06 percent while the German DAX sped ahead, closing up 1.27 percent. Oil prices saw a strong recovery on Monday afternoon after Russia said it was prepared to join a proposed deal to cap the production seen in the oil market in order to tackle the global glut issue. Prices had initially fell during Asia's trade on fading hopes of a deal, yet gained momentum during Europe's trade, providing a boost to U.S. stocks. Up more than 2.5 percent at Europe's close, Brent hovered around $53.35, while U.S. WTI jumped 3 percent at Europe's close, trading at $51.36 per barrel. Meanwhile, a solid uptick in metal prices made basic resources one of the best performing sectors of the day, with ArcelorMittal, BHP Billiton and Anglo American all closing up above 2 percent. Market focus was also on the U.S. on Monday, following the second televised TV debate between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump.

The bank however shot back up in later trade, to close up over 3 percent. Meanwhile, several Italian banks outperformed the broader market, with Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milano both closing up around 6 percent or more. This helped lift Italy's FTSE MIB index, which closed up 1.38 percent. Meanwhile, William Hill shares jumped 2.78 percent after the bookmaker confirmed that it was in merger talks with Canada's Amaya.

165,"WITH AN ELECTION to win in 2020 Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, is sniffing around for popular policies. He has chosen to woo renters. On January 23rd he announced that he would develop a “blueprint for stabilising or controlling private rents in the capital”. One in four Londoners rents privately. On average they send over 40% of their monthly pre-tax income the landlord’s way, a far higher share than in the rest of the country. Mr Khan’s policy is likely to prove popular: more than two-thirds of Londoners are in favour of rent controls. But would it be effective? The mayor is riding the crest of a rent-control wave. Four years ago some German cities introduced controls in areas where rents were deemed too high. In 2017 Scotland gave local councils the power to limit rent increases on certain private tenancies. In November a plan to control rents in California was put to voters in a referendum (it failed). Proposals for rent control appeared in the most recent manifesto of the Labour Party, to which Mr Khan belongs. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. The mayor does not have the power to control rents in London, so changes to legislation would be required. Unfortunately for him, the ruling Conservative Party is not keen on rent controls. And understandably so. The age of rent control in Britain, which lasted from 1915 to 1989, was not a glorious one. Some properties had their rents fixed in cash terms from 1939 to 1957, resulting in a real-terms fall of 60%. As landlords’ returns dwindled they skimped on repairs and upgrades. Many pulled out of the market. The decision in the late 1980s to liberalise rents breathed life back into the market. In the past 30 years investment in dwellings has risen smartly. A case can be made that putting limits on rent rises in the capital now would not cause as much damage as it did in the past. With Brexit uncertainty mounting, London’s private rents have been flat in nominal terms for a year (and have fallen in real terms). For as long as that trend continues any cap would not be tested. The details of Mr Khan’s policy are not yet clear, but he is unlikely to propose the bluntest sort of rent control, in which clipboard-wielding officials march from property to property and tell landlords how much they are allowed to charge. Labour’s nationwide plans offer some clues as to what the mayor might propose to do in London. The party appears to favour allowing landlords to charge whatever they like when a tenancy is newly listed. But landlords would then face tough rules as to how much they could raise rents once a tenancy was under way. That approach might seem more defensible. A landlord has a degree of market power over a sitting tenant because it is a big hassle for a tenant to move out (it is also a bother for a landlord to lose a tenant, but usually less so). Stopping unscrupulous landlords from levying above-market rent rises on vulnerable tenants is appealing. Yet the problem does not seem widespread. Evidence is sparse but data from 2015 suggest that half of renewing tenants were given the same rent on their new contract. Were the cap more aggressive, the impact on the market would be larger. Labour envisages increases in line with inflation. Before the Brexit-related slowdown, rents in London rose only slightly faster than prices. But were a wedge to open between market rents and what was permitted, more incumbent tenants would stay put. Landlords, meanwhile, would want them to leave, so might provide a worse service. When possible they might sell up. A recent study of limits on rent increases and evictions in San Francisco found that the policies decreased the supply of rental housing, causing a 5% city-wide rent increase. There are other ways to help renters. Many have seen their housing costs jump as a result of recent changes to welfare—most notably, a cash-terms freeze on housing benefit that has been in place since 2016. Building more houses would help, too. In 2016-17 Mr Khan exceeded his target for overall housing completions, yet fell well short of the one for “affordable” (ie, state-subsidised) dwellings. Pledges to control rent get the headlines, but the unsexy policies matter a lot more."

169,"* Demand for yield and recent market reforms favour public offerings By Krishna Merchant SINGAPORE, Sept 5 (IFR) - India’s private-sector borrowers are lining up public debt offerings in response to strong investor demand and supportive bond market reforms. Traditionally, corporate bonds have been sold through private placements in India, but some large issuers are finding success via the public route and inspiring others to follow suit. Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) last Monday priced the largest bond from India’s private sector, raising 100 billion rupees ($1.5 billion) in a three-tranche offering, which pulled in bids of 126.45 billion rupees. The offering drew an overwhelming response across all investor types in just two days, said Vikas Dawra, managing director at Yes Securities, a lead manager on the issue. This success would encourage more companies to plan public bond issues, bankers said. Indiabulls Housing Finance aims to raise 70 billion rupees from a public issue of bonds and Srei Infrastructure Finance is targeting 10 billion rupees via the same route. Bankers said non-banking financial companies, such as Edelweiss and Shriram Transport Finance, could also use the public route to raise debt as could entities in other sectors. Public bonds allow issuers to access a wider investor base, with the potential to raise larger amounts, but issuance costs are also higher. “The cost for companies to do a public issue is slightly higher as they have to pay 1.0 to 1.5 percent fees to the arrangers, compared to a 10bp-20bp commission when they place these bonds privately, but it helps diversify the investor base and improves liquidity in the bonds,” said a fixed-income trader. The emergence of large public issues comes after the Reserve Bank of India introduced a rash of regulatory changes last month to improve liquidity and depth in the corporate bond market and make businesses less dependent on bank loans for funding. From the 2017 fiscal year starting in April, major Indian borrowers will be barred from relying on banks for more than 50 percent of their total funding. As a result, some companies are looking to build their market profiles early instead of waiting for the last minute. “Because of RBI’s reforms and successful debuts of large public issues, regular companies are thinking of issuing bonds of larger size to the public, in the range of 5 billion—10 billion rupees,” said Vikas Jain, senior vice president at AK Capital. Chasing higher yields The DHFL issue was oversubscribed across all investor categories, including qualified institutional buyers, corporate and retail. “At the longer tenors, we saw money pour in from retirement funds and insurance companies, as well,” said Jain. For retail investors, a three-year was priced at 9.10 percent, a five-year at 9.20 percent and a seven-year at 9.25 percent. The coupon for QIBs and corporates was set at 9.05 percent across all three tenors. Interest from pension funds was apparent in the secondary market as the bonds offer higher returns than those of state-owned Rural Electrification Corporation and Power Finance Corporate, which yield in the range of 7.3 percent to 7.9 percent. “With the falling interest rate scenario, it becomes more difficult for insurers to earn a reasonable yield on portfolios,” said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Life Insurance. DHFL’s bonds had AAA ratings from Care and Brickwork, providing comfort to investors, he said. With bank deposit rates at around 7.0-7.5 percent, retail investors also found DHFL bonds attractive. While returns look lucrative, investors must do proper due diligence and realise that poor liquidity at some tenors might make it hard to exit their investments, bankers have cautioned. “There is little liquidity in the long duration bonds in the secondary market; we need to see how the liquidity pans out,” said R Sivakumar, head of fixed income at Axis Mutual Fund. AK Capital Services, Axis Bank, Edelweiss, ICICI Bank, IIFL Holdings, Indusind Bank, SBI Capital Markets, Trust Capital and Yes Securities were lead managers on the DHFL issue.

170,"(Refiles to fix typo in headline) Over 400,000 tonnes of gasoline booked out of Europe * Saudi Aramco seeking to buy oil products -traders By Ron Bousso and Ahmad Ghaddar LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Gasoline exports from Europe to the Middle East and Asia are set to surge this week after recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities crippled output at the kingdom's refineries. Over 400,000 tonnes of gasoline and gasoline blending components have been booked in the past week for loading between Sept. 21 and Sept 26 out of northwest Europe with Mideast Gulf delivery options, shipping data shows. The flow is the equivalent of around 500,000 barrels per day. It is unclear where the cargoes will end up, but traders said that Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company Aramco is seeking to buy large volumes of refined oil products. Europe's exports of gasoline and blending components to Saudi Arabia averaged 60,000 bpd in the first five months of the year, according to data analytics firm Vortexa. ""A flurry of gasoline bookings that emerged this week for Europe to Middle East voyages could see more European gasoline make its way to Saudi Arabia,"" Vortexa said in a note. Traders said the rise in shipping bookings was related to a sharp increase in demand following attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure on Sept. 14, which knocked out around 1 million bpd of Saudi Arabia's refining capacity.

171,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - A coalition of Ethiopian opposition parties on Tuesday threatened to boycott a national vote next year without changes to an electoral law they view as biased towards the ruling party. There have been regular parliamentary elections since the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) took power in 1991 but, with one exception, none were competitive. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was appointed last year by the EPRDF after three years of anti-government protests, promising reforms including a credible multi-party poll in 2020. But opposition parties say last month’s changes to the election law in parliament, where the ruling party holds all the seats, made it more difficult for them. One of the amendments raised the number of signatures to register a national party to 10,000, up from 1,500. Regional parties will need 4,000 signatures, up from 750. The opposition was also unhappy at another change requiring civil servants running for office to take leave without pay. “The law was approved in a rush without addressing our demands,” said Girma Bekele, vice chairman of the Joint Council of Political Parties representing 107 opposition groups. “If (the law) is going to be applied without addressing our concerns, it will be repeating what has happened in the previous elections where the ruling party won by 100 percent. We don’t want to be a part of that,” Girma said. The vote is also under threat from ethnic rivalries. The election board in June said that violence, which has driven 2.4 million people out of their homes according to the United Nations, could delay the vote. A national census has already been postponed twice. “Having all our reservations (about the law) puts the upcoming election in question,” Mulatu Gemech, deputy chairman of the opposition Oromo Federalist Congress which is a member of the coalition, told Reuters. There was no immediate comment from the election board or EPRDF. Despite the opposition’s disquiet over the electoral law, Ethiopia’s 100 million citizens are seeing unprecedented political change. Abiy has freed journalists and activists, lifted bans on political parties, and prosecuted officials accused of gross human rights abuses. Writing by Maggie Fick; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne"

Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing ""25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad"" and 51% of those polled, ""agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah."" Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women. Mr. Trump stated, ""Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.

174,"MILAN (Reuters) - Tests conducted on Fiat Chrysler vehicles show they are compliant with regulations and contain no emissions defeat devices as alleged by Germany, Italy’s transport ministry said in a statement on Monday. Tensions have risen between Rome and Berlin over the issue, with German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt saying at the weekend that Fiat Chrysler vehicles breaking emissions rules should be recalled and taken off the streets. “This is an inadmissible suggestion. You don’t give orders to a sovereign nation like Italy,” Italian Transport Minister Graziano Delrio said. Germany last year raised concerns over certain Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) models, including the Fiat 500X, Fiat Doblo and Jeep Renegade, alleging that hidden software allowed excessive emissions by their diesel engines. The issue resurfaced last week when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accused Fiat Chrysler of manipulating emissions tests in its Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles and Ram 1500 pick-up trucks. Fiat Chrysler has denied any wrongdoing. After Italy rejected Germany’s allegations last year, Berlin asked the European Commission to mediate in the dispute. Italy’s transport ministry said on Monday it had “carried out the necessary checks and sent a detailed report to the German authorities which shows that the Fiat 500X, in contrast to what is claimed by Germany, is in compliance with regulations”. It added that the European Commission did not appear to have conducted any tests of its own that would confirm the German allegations. An EU official has told Reuters that the Commission had taken emissions measurements on one rented Fiat 500X model. The Commission last week called on Italy to provide proof against Germany’s allegations. Rome on Monday dismissed Commission accusations that it was dragging its feet in the case, saying it has always responded to requests from Brussels in a punctual manner. The Commission could not immediately be reached for comment. Under an emissions testing regime which the Commission is now seeking to overhaul, national watchdogs approve new cars and have the exclusive power to police manufacturers - though once approved in one country, vehicles can be sold across the bloc. Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests. Earlier this month it said it had negotiated a $4.3 billion draft settlement with U.S. regulators and would plead guilty to criminal misconduct over the issue. As part of a widening clampdown on health-threatening nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution levels in the wake of the VW scandal, the Commission in December began legal action against Germany, Britain and five other EU member states for allegedly failing to police for cheating emissions tests.

175,"Square Feet As schools focus more on safety, some architects are pushing back against a rush to load buildings with security equipment by promoting community over technology. Repeated school shootings have yet to force action on gun control in Washington, but safety advocates are trying to build support for another strategy to keep children safe: smart school design. Two bills pending in Congress would provide school districts with more information about safe school design, as well as money to pay for design services. As districts focus more intently on safety, some architects are pushing back against a rush to load up schools with security equipment by promoting community over technology. “The security industry is growing quickly, and they’re taking advantage of the fears of administrators and parents, selling them things that they’re promising will keep kids safe,” said Jenine Kotob, an architectural designer with Hord Coplan Macht in Alexandria, Va., who became committed to safe school design after a close friend died in the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007. Legislation introduced in the Senate last month calls for the creation of a “school safety clearinghouse” in the Department of Homeland Security that would identify and share best practices on school building design for security and safety. The bill is supported by the American Institute of Architects, a professional organization. The institute is also backing a House bill that would make federal grant money available to school districts through the Stop School Violence Program that could be used for architecture and design services, rather than just security equipment like cameras and metal detectors. A central repository for “unbiased information” on safe school design is urgently needed by local and state school officials, said Jim Brewer, the organization’s managing director of government affairs and policy. “We don’t want them to just be Googling,” he said. One of the greatest concerns among school officials is “their inability to easily sift through the multitude of security options, equipment, technologies” available to them, according to a report released last year by a federal commission on school safety that was convened after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Architects can help school districts find a more “holistic” solution that gives priority to creating a great learning environment, as opposed to a barricade approach, said Jay Brotman, the managing partner at Svigals and Partners, an architecture firm in New Haven, Conn. The firm designed the new Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., after the mass shooting there in 2012. “Instead of hardening, you can create protective layers so kids can still feel connected to the nature outside and to their communities,” he said. “You don’t want them to feel isolated — isolation is the cause of some of these terrible things that have happened.” But the idea that the country would begin cataloging the school design strategies best suited to preventing shootings without also tightening access to guns does not sit well with some. Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a vocal advocate of stiffer gun control measures since the Newtown shootings, suggested in an emailed statement that he was not ready to support the clearinghouse measure. “Let’s be honest — the most important thing we can do to address the problem of gun violence in our communities is to strengthen our gun laws,” Mr. Murphy said. “Let’s start there.” Mr. Brotman acknowledged that there were similar sentiments among architects. But he said schools built around a set of established principles known as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design would protect children better from a host of threats, including bullying and gang violence. These design principles call for buildings that allow those inside to see the outside surroundings easily; tight control of access, starting at the perimeter of the property and moving inward; and transparency within the building. At the new Sandy Hook school, which opened in 2016, a rain garden across the front creates a natural barrier between the building and the parking lot. The garden area serves as a filter for rainwater runoff from the roof. But it also requires visitors to the school to cross one of three bridges to enter, limiting entry points and giving staff members a clear view of who is coming in, Mr. Brotman said. The ground around the building slopes away. That allows the classroom windows to be low enough for children to see out while still being high above the ground. The school has plenty of security equipment as well, like cameras and automatic lockdown capability. But the focus was on creating “a fabulous learning environment for the children,” while keeping the security technology as unobtrusive as possible, Mr. Brotman said. JCJ Architecture, with offices in seven states, emphasized good visibility and openness in its design of Hunking Middle School in Haverhill, Mass., said James E. LaPosta Jr., a principal and chief architectural officer at the firm. Opened in 2016, the school has wide, naturally lit hallways that are open to view from classroom windows and glass-walled gathering spaces. Collaborative study areas in some hallways add more of a sense of activity, reducing opportunities for bullying, Mr. LaPosta said. “It ensures that adults have visibility in all areas,” he said. “But there are still places of refuge.” For example, lockers are positioned on the outside of classroom walls to provide a shield behind which students can hide if necessary and not be seen from the hallway. Doors connecting classrooms provide another way out of the rooms. Michael Pinto, a principal in the Los Angeles office of NAC Architecture, said he had become a “reluctant expert” in such design practices because he had seen communities overreact and sacrifice proven design strategies for effective learning in a rush to address safety concerns. “We want to make sure the safety discussion doesn’t overwhelm the other things we have to think about,” he said. Yet research into the effectiveness of design as a way to prevent crime in schools is scarce, aside from a few studies that found that the approach had made students feel safer on college campuses, said Auzeen Shariati, an assistant professor of criminal justice at St. Joseph’s College in Patchogue, N.Y. Ms. Kotob of Hord Coplan Macht acknowledged that there was not much empirical data to back up the effectiveness of the design principles in schools but said studies were being conducted. Her firm just finished designing a student life center at the Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart, a private girls’ school in Bethesda, Md. The designers sought ideas from a security task force of parents and administrators, who suggested changes like moving an outdoor dining terrace away from the street and behind a landscaped buffer zone. The building will have hardened glass in the main vestibule to prevent anyone from breaking through. Glass will also be used strategically throughout the building to give teachers high visibility, she said. Classrooms are designed to have “blind spots” where students can hide from the hallway. Some school safety advocates seek to push the discussion further. Communities should not limit discussions about school safety to the structure of the building, said Deborah Temkin, a senior program area director specializing in school health and climate at Child Trends, a research organization in Bethesda. Often, the threat to safety comes from within, and a student walking the halls every day who wants to commit an act of violence can figure out where the blind spots are, she said. “What we know works is building a community where there is mutual trust,” she said. “Open lines of communication, mechanisms to engage with teachers in multiple ways, making sure at least one adult is connected to every single student in some way. It all has to be integrated.”"
176,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The launch of the new European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, is likely to be delayed by a month because the European Parliament has rejected three candidates proposed by EU governments for commissioners, several EU officials said on Monday. Josep Borrell, the incoming EU foreign affairs chief, told reporters in Luxembourg it was “reasonable” to expect a delay of the start of the new Commission of Ursula von der Leyen until Dec. 1 from the original date of Nov. 1. The delay is to give the governments of Hungary, Romania and France time to propose new candidates for commissioners after their initial choices failed to pass European Parliament hearings. “The schedule of when exactly the new Commission can be in place is in the hands of the three governments and the European Parliament,” one EU official said. A likely date for a parliamentary vote approving the Commission as a whole was a plenary session in Strasbourg on Nov. 28, the official said. Delays of in the new Commission taking office are not unusual. The EU executive headed by Jose Manuel Barroso had a three week delay in 2004 because the parliament rejected the Italian Rocco Buttiglione for commissioner. The second Barroso commission started even later, only in February 2010, because of the time needed to organize a parliamentary hearing for Kristalina Georgieva who replaced the also rejected Bulgarian candidate Rumiana Jeleva.

Do you believe that the Trump White House aggressively obstructed and impeded the FBI background check on Kavanaugh and aggressively prevented FBI interviews with key corroborating witnesses suggested by the women? When a significant number of credible witnesses who came forward pleading to be interviewed by the FBI were treated disrespectfully and contemptuously and were refused the opportunity to present the facts and evidence, do you believe this constituted a search for truth? Do you believe that Judge Kavanaugh told the truth during his confirmation testimony about his behavior when he was in prep school and college on matters related to the allegations of the women, or do you believe he testified falsely under oath? If it is true that Kavanaugh was not interviewed during the FBI background check, why do you believe Kavanaugh or the White House prevented him from being questioned? When Trump launched his mocking, ridiculing and insulting attack against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, do you understand why this attack did so much damage to women across America making the hard decision of whether to come forward or remain silent after they have been assaulted? Today, there are women across America who are making the agonizing decision about whether to come forward with their stories of being sexually assaulted.

Do you believe FBI Director Christopher Wray should be called to testify about whether or not the FBI background check on Kavanaugh was obstructed by White House interference with the FBI?  Why don’t you contact the FBI director privately and ask him this question before you cast your votes? There are public reports that Wray is keeping contemporaneous notes about White House limits imposed against the FBI background check.

178,"After EPA Administrator Scott PruittEdward (Scott) Scott PruittEnvironmentalists renew bid to overturn EPA policy barring scientists from advisory panels Six states sue EPA over pesticide tied to brain damage Overnight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules MORE announced that he will implement a policy to make our government more accountable to the American people, we’ve seen massive media coverage misrepresenting the potential effects of such a policy. Regrettably, the EPA is able to make rules and regulations based on data that not even rule-makers at the agency have seen. It’s time to change that. We all want clean air and clean water, both today and for future generations. It is the EPA’s mission to ensure that happens. We all also agree that the best available science should underlie EPA’s rules and regulations. I have long worked to implement a policy that requires the EPA to base its rules on science that is publicly available. Opponents disagree – they prefer to keep this data hidden. But if we do that, how could we – scientists, policymakers and American citizens – confirm that the regulations that dramatically impact our lives are based on the best available science? If all we can see are studies’ conclusions, we don’t know whether those conclusions are based on sound science. Those who oppose making the data public claim it will expose personal information. But confidential patient data and other personal information should and can be kept private. Making data publicly available, as I’ve advocated in the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act (HONEST Act), does not mean making confidential information available to anyone with a keyboard. In fact, there are several ways to make data public without revealing any confidential information. Redacting personally identifying information is one option that agencies across the federal government have used for years. Where redaction would limit the quality of datasets for individuals who wish to see the data underlying a study, access could be granted after they agree to keep the data confidential. Much of the data that is currently available already requires those requesting datasets to fulfill contractual obligations, preventing them from disseminating confidential patient information. While the HONEST Act’s opponents ignore these facts, others in the scientific community recognize the importance of access to data. The Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Public Land-Grant Universities (APLU) recently provided recommendations for agencies implementing the Obama administration’s public access requirements. The AAU and APLU highlight the “growing demand among scholars and the public to have broader access to each other’s data” and recommend that the minimum standard be “data that are essential to understanding and reproducing peer reviewed publications ... to be accessible for re-analysis,” while adhering to rules protecting personal information. Those in the scientific community who support disclosing data while protecting confidential information should also support the HONEST Act, which furthers the same goals. Many opponents of open data have wrongly concluded that requiring new regulations to be based on “publicly available” data will disqualify studies from being considered. A recent article alleges that such a policy would “force the EPA to ignore” studies based on confidential health information. This argument is fraudulent. The reality is that the EPA will consider these studies when they adhere to the publicly available standard. Open access to science is a goal that furthers public debate and benefits the American people. So the HONEST Act is receiving unfounded criticism from those who know that the data may not justify the regulations. The American people have a right to understand why and how regulatory decisions are made. Smith is chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. View the discussion thread.

179,"(Corrects spelling of Van Bavel in third paragraph) By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Highly intelligent people may be more rather than less likely to succumb to motivated reasoning, cherry-picking evidence to reinforce their existing beliefs and ignoring contradictory data. Even with people with high numerally skills were unable to reason analytically when the correct answer collided with their political beliefs, according to a forthcoming journal article in “Trends in Cognitive Sciences”. In fact, people with high information-processing skills were the most likely to express beliefs consistent with their political standpoint (“The partisan brain: an identity-based model of political belief” Van Bavel and Pereira, 2018). The authors focus on the role of ideology and political partisanship in the United States, but many of the same arguments about motivated reasoning apply to the energy sector. Many of the most important issues in the energy world, including the impact of OPEC on oil prices, climate change, the transition to clean energy, the future of fossil fuels and electric cars, renewable energy and peak oil, have become intensely emotional. In some cases, the intensity of energy debates has been heightened because it has become conflated with political partisanship. In others, the ferocity of disputes stem from origins that lie outside politics. Views about peaking oil demand, electric cars and OPEC have become an important marker of social identity, and people will cling to them even when presented with contradictory evidence. The problem with motivated reasoning is that it strongly distorts not just policy preferences but the way people process information and even the way they perceive and interpret the same piece of data. The authors blame much of this motivated reasoning on the “tribal nature” of the human mind, which leads people to value dogma over truth. Belief in a particular ideology, whether about politics or an issue in the energy sector, provides an important and satisfying sense of group belonging as well as access to resources and patronage. But when the demands of ideology and group membership clash with the evidence, many individuals will disregard contradictory data rather than modify their thinking or risk losing group approval. “Social identities have been shown to shape the way people interpret information. In turn, interpretations of the world shape political attitudes, judgements and behaviours,” Van Bavel and Pereira write. “Because people believe that they see the world around them objectively, members of other parties who disagree with them are seen as uninformed, irrational or biased.” “Partisan identities bias a broad range of judgements, even when presented with facts that contradict them,” according to the authors. What the authors describe as “our ancient capacity for tribalism”, recognising similar characteristics in others, may originally have served a useful evolutionary purpose. But it can be fatal to a calm and constructive analysis of problems whether they are about high politics or energy issues. Many of the fierce disagreements around future peaks in oil demand and the uptake of electric vehicles, for example, or the impact of OPEC on oil prices, are not really disagreements about technical issues but disputes about values and ideology. Tribalism is what turns so many discussions about energy into an emotive shouting match between opponents who accuse each other of being at best uninformed and incompetent or at worst mendacious. In most cases, energy professionals would be better served by dialling back on the heated rhetoric and exploring the issues more calmly and with an open mind. Unfortunately, much of the analysis in the energy sector comes from individuals and institutions promoting a distinctive viewpoint rather than taking a more data-driven empirical approach. Dispassionate analysis has often become inextricably mixed up with highly motivated lobbying and advocacy, to the severe detriment to the quality of the analysis. In general, individuals and institutions can be good analysts, or good lobbyist/advocates, but not both. Mixing the two is almost always a mistake.

180,"SAO PAULO, March 7 (Reuters) - Brazil's move to accelerate construction of an electric line to the northern state of Roraima, which now relies on crisis-ridden Venezuela for power, could violate the rights of indigenous peoples whose land it must cross, a federal prosecutor told Reuters. Roraima is not connected to the rest of Brazil's power grid, and its electricity supply from Venezuela has experienced outages amid that country's economic collapse. President Jair Bolsonaro's stance against the Venezuelan government of Nicolas Maduro, including his recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's interim president, has raised fears Maduro could cut off power coming across the border. The power line project to connect Roraima with the power grid in Amazonas state was auctioned off in 2011, but it has been held up in the licensing process. The power line must cut across 120 kms (75 miles) of an indigenous reserve, home to the Waimiri-Atroari, who were nearly wiped out in the last century, complicating the process. Presidential spokesman Otavio Rego Barros said last week the government would declare the project ""of national interest,"" allowing it to obtain an installation license in time to start construction in the second half of this year. That could potentially speed up or skip the step requiring the indigenous tribe to be consulted. ""The measure could be challenged. I'm concerned over the attempt to simplify the debate, as if the Indians were a hindrance or impediment to construction,"" Julio Jose Araujo Jr., a federal prosecutor in Amazonas state, said in an interview this week. Consultations with the affected indigenous people are required but nonbinding for the project's ultimate approval, and Araujo argued that the obligation has not been taken seriously since the start. ""There is a clear silencing of these groups in the construction of the project, since its conception,"" he said Federal prosecutors have launched various challenges, including one that would have made the consultations binding, but that was struck down by a court in January. Barros, the presidential spokesman, said the government wants to talk with indigenous leaders but that ""the interest of national sovereignty overrides other issues."" The Waimiri-Atroari have been nearly wiped out since the beginning of the 1900s due to diseases after contact with settlers and after fighting with the military. ""You can call it genocide ... it was decades of attacks, massacres and epidemic deaths,"" said Stephen Baines, a University of Brasilia anthropologist who studied the group in the 1970s.

182,"Burlington Stores could be the next retailer to rebound, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday. The stock was crushed, plunging 16%, after a rare sales miss in its most recent earnings results. Cramer pointed out that the March report marked the first time in 24-consecutive quarters that same-store-sales growth did not meet estimates. ""I think you should buy this stock ahead of ... Wednesday, when I expect everyone to hear that Burlington's issues have been cleared up,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Burlington's ""mea culpa was overdone"" on the earnings call, Cramer said. He compared Burlington to Home Depot, the shares of which also plummeted after disappointing fourth-quarter earnings and sales. The home improvement retailer said a bad weather during the three-month span cut into foot traffic and, in turn, sales at its stores. Shares of Home Depot have since recovered those losses and risen above its February levels, climbing more than 18% in 2019. Burlington looks to be in a similar position, Cramer said. Despite weak sales in its women's apparel and winter inventories, other items sold as according to plan, he said. With spring in full swing, investors will forget the winter ailments that plagued some of the best merchants out there, he added. ""[CEO Tom] Kingsbury's got a fantastic team and I don't think they're gonna repeat whatever fashion mistakes they made last quarter. They're too talented to mess up the same way twice,"" Cramer said. Kingsbury has helmed the company for more than a decade. Furthermore, Burlington is sending representatives to give a Wednesday presentation at JP Morgan Chase's annual Boss' Retail Round-Up Conference, the host noted. Cramer expects the company to illustrate that spring weather will be a boost for its stores. ""If that happens, the stock would rebound like a coiled spring from these levels,"" he said.

183,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian gas grid company Snam has launched a 33 million euro ($40 million) tender to convert its car fleet to natural gas in a sign of its commitment to develop gas fuelling stations in the country. The move comes as utilities across Europe race to embrace the fast-growing business of rolling out charging stations to meet carmaker pledges to move fleets to electric drives. Snam, controlled by state lender CDP, said in a tender it had set a Feb. 16 deadline for bids from European companies to convert its 1,500 vehicle fleet to natural gas. The supply contracts will be for three years, it said. Europe’s biggest gas pipeline operator has pledged to spend 150 million euros to build 300 new gas fuelling stations to beef up the country’s existing 1,100 points. Italy is the leading European market for natural gas-fuelled cars, with motorists guzzling more than 1 billion cubic meters in 2015 and about 1 million vehicles in circulation. Snam CEO Marco Alvera told Reuters that by adding more stations the market could expand to 2-3 million vehicles and would be able to complement electric cars. “I drive a hybrid car, and I think the future will be gas and electricity - plug-in hybrids,” he said. Snam is looking to play a key role in helping develop new gas infrastructure and technology for Italy’s transport sector including the use of liquefied natural gas to drive ships. It has already inked deals with oil major Eni and leading petrol pump network API as well as carmaker Fiat Chrysler. Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne is one of the few car bosses who has largely resisted the plug-in vogue, signing a deal with Eni in November to study new gas fuels to reduce carbon emissions. Snam makes most of its money from gas transmission in Italy and Europe but under Alvera has been looking for ways to create new faster-growing businesses to attract investors. Last April it signed an agreement to help modernize Ukraine’s gas network. ($1 = 0.8321 euros) Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by Adrian Croft"

187,"TO A casual observer of the past week’s news, it might seem as though Britain’s university application process was designed to dissuade black students. The latest outbreak of the debate about access was prompted by a revelation by David Lammy, a Labour MP and former education minister, that ten out of 32 colleges at Oxford and six out of 29 at Cambridge did not admit a single black A-level pupil in 2015. Mr Lammy accused the universities of fostering “social apartheid”. Despite enduring problems in gaining access to the most elite institutions, and evidence that some universities accept fewer black candidates than would be expected given their grades, black pupils are more likely than most to attend university. Some 57% of those classified as “black African” and 37% of those classified as “black Caribbean” go to university, compared with 33% of white pupils (see chart). “What goes on in a few colleges in Oxford is not representative of higher education as a whole,” notes Jacqueline Stevenson of Sheffield Hallam University. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Yet once enrolled, black students do worse than those of other ethnic groups. Half get firsts or upper-seconds, compared with 78% of white students. A study by the Department for Education in 2007 found that a significant gap remained even when adjusting for things like the type of university, prior attainment and poverty. Black students are also more likely than average to drop out, with more than 10% not finishing their degrees. What explains the gap? One argument advanced by student activists is that black students are alienated by an education system that does not reflect their experience. “Why Is My Curriculum White?”, a campaign that began at University College London, challenges the “Eurocentric nature” and “whiteness” of what is taught. Another campaign, “Rhodes Must Fall”, argued that a statue of the Victorian colonialist at Oxford symbolised that the university was not for black students. Across Britain, just 0.4% of professors are black. Universities have focused on more practical obstacles. Black students are more likely than average to live at home (in part because many attend university in London, where rent is eye-wateringly expensive) and students who live at home are more likely to drop out. One university discovered that tickets for freshers’ events were being sold only in halls of residence, excluding those living at home. Although universities are slowly waking up to the issue, faster change is needed, says Ilyas Nagdee of the National Union of Students. After crunching data in 2012, Nona McDuff, a senior official at Kingston University, realised that the gap in performance could not be explained by students’ choice of subject, their work outside of university or other similar factors. Rather, there was enough to say that “it was something we were doing.” As a result, Kingston made a variety of changes. It has set up cheap “flexi-stay” accommodation to allow those with a long commute to stay over if they have an early start the next morning. Lecturers get credit for showing that they have thought about the ethnicity gap when being assessed for promotion. Kingston’s governing board now judges the university’s success partly by whether it has made progress in closing the divide. Although many of the changes were small, the cumulative effect has been to narrow the ethnic-minority attainment gap by ten percentage points in five years. Other universities would be well advised to pay attention."

189,"The Group of Seven (G-7) summit is set to end without a joint communique for the first time in its 44-year history, after French President Emmanuel Macron decided to abandon the tradition citing ""a very deep crisis of democracy."" It will be the first time since meetings began in 1975 that the forum has failed to end a summit without an agreed statement, laying bare the deepening rift between heads of state from seven of the world's largest economies. Speaking to reporters ahead of the G-7 meeting at a news conference in Paris on Wednesday, Macron said an attempt to produce a joint communique would most likely be a ""pointless"" exercise. He referenced President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from a landmark climate agreement restricting global efforts to cut carbon as one example of why it would be difficult to display a united front. The annual summit brings together the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. It will be held in the seaside town of Biarritz in southwest France from Saturday through to Monday. Securing an agreement at the annual summit has proved increasingly difficult in recent years, partly because the U.S. president has expressed a preference for bilateral trade pacts over multilateral agreements. ""It is impossible to predict what the U.S. will do — we might be in for some surprises from Trump,"" Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), told CNBC via telephone. ""I'm not sure what he is going to do, maybe Trump doesn't know either,"" Demarais said, citing the U.S. as a notable exception in its approach to handling disputes. Last year, at the G-7 summit in Ottawa, Canada, Trump threw typically stage-managed proceedings into disarray. The U.S. president made an early exit from the meeting, refused to sign the collective final statement and engaged in personal insults over trade with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The summit appeared to demonstrate fraying ties between the U.S. and its traditional allies, with one photo seemingly summing up divisions in the room. The image, which appeared on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Instagram account, showed world leaders gathered around Merkel on one side of a table, while a seated Trump looked on with his arms folded. From a French perspective, the hosts will ""want to try to manage this G-7 so it doesn't turn into another embarrassing mess with everyone arguing with each other,"" Constantine Fraser, European political analyst at the TS Lombard research group, told CNBC via telephone. ""I think it is quite possible"" there will be no joint communique at the end of this year's summit, Fraser said, before adding the statement was now little more than an ""increasingly desperate fig leaf."" ""The G-7 is no longer for the world's richest countries to show a united front... And the lack of a joint communique is a recognition of where we are at,"" Fraser said. French media dubbed last year's gathering in Ottawa as the ""G-6+1 summit,"" citing Washington's refusal to sign the final statement. Alongside environment and trade, analysts expect Brexit, inequality, the possible reinstatement of Russia and universal taxation on digital giants to dominate proceedings. Late last month, Trump warned he ""might"" slap tariffs on French wine in response to the country's new tax affecting technology companies. ""This is a very, very contentious topic. France wants to impose this digital tax but the problem is most digital giants are American,"" the EIU's Demarais said. France passed a 3% charge in early July that would affect firms such as Facebook and Google. It is expected to draw about $28 million or more in revenue from digital services in France. The Trump administration has since started an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. ""France has decided to go ahead with this tax knowing it will provoke the U.S. ... Trump will get angry and there will probably be a big row about it,"" TS Lomabrd's Fraser said."
190,"(Reuters) - Former Vice President Joe Biden unveiled a plan on Tuesday to reform the U.S. criminal justice system by lowering incarceration rates, ending the federal death penalty and eliminating racial disparities in how people are sentenced. Biden, the Democratic front-runner in the party’s nominating contest to take on Republican President Donald Trump in next year’s election, has faced criticism over his support for a 1994 crime bill that some say contributed to mass incarceration, especially of black men. That bill, signed into law by former Democratic President Bill Clinton when Biden was a U.S. senator, greatly increased funding for the construction of new federal prisons and included a ‘three strikes’ provision, which required a mandatory life sentence for a person guilty of committing a severe, violent felony after two previous convictions. On the campaign trail, Biden has said the 1994 law did not contribute to mass incarceration. Studies show that incarceration rates steadily increased in the United States from the early 1970s to around 2010, and the 1994 bill was just part of the “tough on crime” movement of that era which led to more prison sentences. Under Biden’s new plan, he would aim to reduce the U.S. prison population, in part by ending the jailing of people solely for drug use offences. He would also create a $20 billion grant program to incentivize states to shift their focus from jailing people to preventing crime. Biden, 76, supported the death penalty for decades and the 1994 crime bill made additional offenses punishable by death. Under his new proposal, Biden calls for scrapping the death penalty at the federal level, and spurring states to follow the federal government’s example by sentencing people to life without parole, rather than executing them. One of Biden’s rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, U.S. Senator Kamala Harris from California, has criticized Biden over his support for the 1994 crime bill. In the first televised Democratic debate last month, she also attacked Biden over recent remarks he made defending his work with former segregationist senators. Biden and Harris will share the stage again in another nationally televised debate next week. “People are going to weaponize his service in Congress against him,” a senior Biden campaign official said. “He is not going to allow his record to be mischaracterized. This plan is a true reflection of what he believes: he believes in second chances.” The plan would also end the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine, which have been viewed as racially biased and unfair. It would decriminalize the use of cannabis and expunge all prior cannabis use convictions. Harris is set to introduce a Senate bill on Tuesday to enact legislation on similar lines. Biden will also seek to end racial disparities in the criminal justice system, including providing greater access to quality public defenders, ending mandatory minimum sentences, and scrapping the cash bail system, which Biden described as “the modern-day debtors’ prison.” Reporting by Tim Reid in Los Angeles, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien"

I find many teams are willing to work around an individual collaborator’s inability to travel a lot. This could encourage the worker to consider options within the current company, which might prove beneficial. ANONYMOUS Your reader who is eight years from retirement and hates her job might do well to look into what is often called “job crafting.” Perhaps there is some way to remake the job or remake how the person thinks about his job, and end up feeling more fulfilled. Even if that doesn’t work, the person might still use some of those approaches to craft the next job, to make it as fulfilling as possible. A positive psychology career coach (I am one) can help with this. GAYLE SCROGGS, EASTON, MD. That column inspired quite a few responses. And I think the idea expressed in these two replies — to make this less of a binary stay-or-go decision, and instead try to reshape the job at hand — deserves further exploration. In fact, I was curious enough about Gayle Scroggs’s positive-psychology take on job crafting that I gave her a call, and then explored academic research on the subject. But before I get to that, it’s worth briefly sharing some of the other feedback I received. The column argued for thinking hard about exploring new options with an open mind, suggesting that one would most likely regret giving in to the idea that there’s no choice but to ride out those unhappy years until retirement. And indeed a number of readers offered their own anecdotes of late-career-change success stories. One quit Wall Street for a public sector job in Rhode Island, and called the move “very rewarding.” Another described two years working (and networking) her way toward escaping a “toxic boss” and unhappy work culture. “At 59, I switched jobs last year and have never been happier,” she wrote. “Make a plan, set yourself a deadline, and do the work.” A couple of readers actually suggested I was too wishy-washy about arguing for a change: “One might get to a traditional retirement age and not be able to enjoy life,” one reader argued, “so why put off living the very best life one can possibly have each and every day?” That said, a few readers sounded cautionary notes. One described going back to school to switch career trajectories — and having a hard time finding work afterward. “Looking back, I wish I had done more research on education after age 50,” this person wrote. “This was a costly option and I now have many regrets.” On Twitter, another reader cited the work of Herminia Ibarra, a professor of organizational behavior at London Business School, who has advocated a “test-and-learn” approach to career management: experimenting with new work interests on a smaller scale, rather than making a sweeping change. That idea is not very far from trying to reshape one’s current job rather than dump it for a new one. Job crafting, it turns out, is a term associated with the work of Amy Wrzesniewski, a professor of organizational behavior at the Yale School of Management. It involves focusing on the elements of your job that you can control, to steadily reshape your own gig. This might mean emphasizing certain tasks over others, or changing the nature and frequency of interaction with particular colleagues. Those might seem like marginal actions, but the idea is they can add up to a more satisfying day-to-day experience. They can also help you work with your boss to adjust your responsibilities so that they better match your (evolving) skills, Ms. Scroggs suggested when we spoke. “Work on engagement,” she said. “You want to have a supervisor who cares about you, and say ‘This is how I do my best work, can I do it this way?’” So asking for something like a reduction in work travel can be positioned as something that isn’t just better for you, it’s better for the organization. Job crafting can sound more like a coping strategy than a plan for discovering your calling — but sometimes that may be appropriate. It can be helpful to frame such changes as something practical and doable, not radical and dramatic. Ms. Scroggs recounted coaching one burned-out client to make her commute more enjoyable, and invite friends to lunch, for example. “I focused her on appreciating the positive things,” rather than obsessing over the negatives, Ms. Scroggs said. These modest-sounding actions, barely related to work itself, ended up improving the client’s performance and overall comfort with her job. “Then she told me the bad news,” Ms. Scroggs added with a laugh, “which was that she didn’t need me anymore.”"

To think otherwise is naive,"" the so-called commodities king said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now "" when discussing expectations that OPEC will not arrive at a deal for a production freeze. For context, the cartel indicated in September that the framework for a deal had been agreed upon. Then OPEC member Saudi Arabia issued $17.5 billion worth of bonds in October. The editor and publisher of ""The Gartman Letter doubled-down on his bearish thesis calling for oil to head lower from current levels. Now, when seeking an honest indicator in the global market, Gartman recommended looking outside of OPEC toward Russia. ""The only fellow speaking the truth about crude oil was [Igor] Sechin,"" explained Gartman. Sechin, CEO of Rosneft, an oil company majority owned by the Russian government, recently expressed a desire to increase production. ""When everybody else was saying that they were going to curtail production, Sechin said, 'Why should I?'"" Gartman noted that, despite OPEC's tough talk, the cartel's hand was forced when Rosneft indicated intent to produce heavily, not scale back. Russia's conviction, coupled with cartel discord has Gartman looking toward a potential breakdown for crude heading into winter. ""You probably have to take WTI down now to $40, "" warned Gartman. ""You need to take it down there to stop ... production facilities here and to stop people from bringing on old wells that had been drilled and capped. At $40, they'll probably stay capped."" This notion comes alongside a note from Goldman Sachs wherein the bank agrees that further infighting among OPEC members could drive the price of oil to $40 per barrel. ""I think we take crude down into the low 40s, which is a break in trend lines as the cantango continues to widen,"" concluded Gartman. ""If I can tell people to do anything it's watch the term structure and watch the contango because it tells you more than anything. As the market was rallying a week and a half ago, crude was bidding for storage and the contango was widening. That told you that the peak was in. For right now, demand is weak, supply is large and oil prices want to go down."" OPEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

195,"THE new year finds Britain tense. Brexit looms: Theresa May will soon start the two-year countdown. There is still the tangle of divisions that contributed to last June’s referendum vote. The gaps between liberal, Remain-voting places and conservative, Leave-voting ones will widen as the trade-offs of Brexit become clear. Cultural grievances concerning rapid inflows of foreigners, and of existing immigrants perceived to have integrated poorly, remain unresolved. Racist slogans have appeared on walls and hate crimes are up. Still Mrs May refuses to guarantee European Union citizens the right to stay put. “A disunited Kingdom”, bellow headlines. How to reunite it? Debates rage over Louise Casey’s review into integration, published last month. Commissioned by David Cameron, the civil servant’s report paints a grim picture of a land cleft by segregation, where citizens live parallel lives. It recommends that schools teach British values and that immigrants take an oath of loyalty (an idea endorsed by Sajid Javid, the communities secretary). Much of the opposition agrees, Stephen Kinnock urging his fellow Labour MPs to “move away from multiculturalism and towards assimilation”. On January 5th a new Parliamentary group on integration advocated a middle way between the two approaches. Expect more in this vein as the year unfolds. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Much of it will be warranted. Segregation scars parts of Britain, some immigrant groups remain poorly integrated and minorities within them are hostile to liberal values. But the gloom lacks a sense of the bigger picture. Accompany Bagehot to Ely, a cathedral city sprouting from the prairies of eastern England, where thousands of central and eastern Europeans have moved to pick vegetables for low wages—and where many have settled. Your columnist visited on December 23rd to witness the segregation. What better litmus test than Christmas, with its many national variations? Sure enough, the local Poles’ traditions were widely evident. In a shop named “White & Red”, green-grey carp glistened in ice boxes; shelves groaned with pierogi (dumplings) and bottles of bison-grass vodka; piles of sachets variously containing hay and communion wafers teetered by the till. Gosia Bates and Joanna Bialas, two locals, explained that each ingredient features in the Wigilia, or Christmas Eve, meal. This involves hay scattered on the floor (to evoke the nativity), wafers broken before the meal and 12 dishes including carp, herring, pierogi, mushrooms, beetroot soup and poppy-seed cake. No meat or alcohol is taken, so the vodka comes out at midnight. The steady traffic of local Poles in the shop spoke to the strength of this foreign culture. “Every year my uncle sends me this from Silesia, for good financial luck,” said Mrs Bates, producing a shiny carp scale from her purse. Below the surface, however, something else is happening. Britons also shop at “White & Red”, lured by the garlicky sausage and crusty bread. And Poles are picking up British habits like eating turkey and watching the queen’s Christmas speech. Those who, like Mrs Bates, have British partners are leading the fusion: her Anglo-Polish son receives British chocolate from the Polish St Nicholas on December 6th; her Christmas tree is decorated towards the start of the month (the British way) but will stay up well into January (the Polish way); her son receives half of his presents on December 24th (Polish) and half on the 25th (British). She serves turkey on Christmas Day, as is typical in Britain, but also leaves a chair empty—a Polish tradition respecting strangers. When relatives visit she cooks an English breakfast, which they love (apart from the baked beans). She enjoys crackers but feels “a bit silly with a paper hat on my head”. Ms Bialas plans to create a similar mix of cultures for her baby, due in 2017. Without oaths, integration classes or other forms of state do-goodery, central European cultures in Britain are melding with local ones. Children are leading the way. Right after the Brexit vote teachers in Ely had to sooth not just upset Polish pupils but also British ones who fretted about losing their pals. Ms Bialas describes school pick-up time, when Polish and British parents tend to stick to their own, but children pour out in a multinational muddle. Ask the Polish ones which football teams they support, she says, and they often name two: one Polish and one British. Some have become so British that they now struggle in their native tongue, getting A* grades in maths but Ds in Polish written exams. This even extends to the liturgy. Mariusz Urbanowski, a local Polish priest, says he mixes the two languages in his festive services, to cater for different generations of Anglo-Poles. Such is the Britain forgotten by the gloomsters. Fully 82% of its citizens socialise at least monthly with people from different ethnic or religious backgrounds; from 2003 to 2016 the proportion calling their vicinity “cohesive” rose from 80% to 89%; over half of first-generation migrants have friends of a different ethnicity (among their kids the proportion is nearer three-quarters); numbers of inter-ethnic marriages and households are rising; educational and employment gaps are shrinking. The proportion of British-Pakistani households using English as their main language rose from 15% to 45% in the 13 years to 2010. The story of British life in 2017 is that new immigrants are enriching and combining with this mongrel culture as loyally as their predecessors once did. In pubs and churches, gyms and schools, Britishness is being made and remade not by political diktat but by an organic process of mixing and mingling. Britain contains few French-style banlieues or American-style ghettos. London’s mayor is a liberal Muslim. Sikhs in turbans protect Buckingham Palace. Tikka masala (Indian-ish) and fish and chips (Jewish-ish) are the country’s national dishes. Polish-ish pierogi will surely join them soon. In a troubled age, let this diverse country take more pride in all that. Economist.com/blogs/bagehot"
196,"Sometimes it feels as if Internet platforms are turning everything upside down, from politics to publishing, culture to commerce, and of course swapping truth for lies. This week’s bizarro reversal was the vista of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, a tech CEO famed for being entirely behind the moral curve of understanding what his product is platforming (i.e. nazis), providing an impromptu ‘tweet storm’ in political speech ethics. Actually he was schooling Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg — another techbro renowned for his special disconnect with the real world, despite running a massive free propaganda empire with vast power to influence other people’s lives — in taking a stand for the good of democracy and society. So not exactly a full reverse then. In short, Twitter has said it will no longer accept political ads, period. A final note. This isn’t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It’s worth stepping back in order to address. — jack 🌍🌏🌎 (@jack) October 30, 2019 Whereas Facebook recently announced it will no longer fact-check political ads. Aka: Lies are fine, so long as you’re paying Facebook to spread them. You could argue there’s a certain surface clarity to Facebook’s position — i.e. it sums to ‘when it comes to politics we just won’t have any ethics’. Presumably with the hoped for sequitur being ‘so you can’t accuse us of bias’. Though that’s actually a non sequitur; by not applying any ethical standards around political campaigns Facebook is providing succour to those with the least ethics and the basest standards. So its position does actually favor the ‘truth-lite’, to put it politely. (You can decide which political side that might advantage.) Twitter’s position also has surface clarity: A total ban! Political and issue ads both into the delete bin. But as my colleague Devin Coldewey quickly pointed out it’s likely to get rather more fuzzy around the edges as the company comes to defining exactly what is (and isn’t) a ‘political ad’ — and what its few “exceptions” might be. Indeed, Twitter’s definitions are already raising eyebrows. For example it has apparently decided climate change is a ‘political issue’ — and will therefore be banning ads about science. While, presumably, remaining open to taking money from big oil to promote their climate-polluting brands... So yeah, messy. hi – here's our current definition: 1/ Ads that refer to an election or a candidate, or2/ Ads that advocate for or against legislative issues of national importance (such as: climate change, healthcare, immigration, national security, taxes) — Vijaya Gadde (@vijaya) October 30, 2019 There will clearly be attempts to stress test and circumvent the lines Twitter is setting. The policy may sound simple but it involves all sorts of judgements that expose the company’s political calculations and leave it open to charges of bias and/or moral failure. Still, setting rules is — or should be — the easy and adult thing to do when it comes to content standards; enforcement is the real sweating toil for these platforms. Which is also, presumably, why Facebook has decided to experiment with not having any rules around political ads — in the (forlorn) hope of avoiding being forced into the role of political speech policeman. If that’s the strategy it’s already looking spectacularly dumb and self-defeating. The company has just set itself up for an ongoing PR nightmare where it is indeed forced to police intentionally policy-provoking ads from its own back-foot — having put itself in the position of ‘wilfully corrupt cop’. Slow hand claps all round. Albeit, it can at least console itself it’s monetizing its own ethics bypass. Here is @AOC's full questioning of Mark Zuckerberg. ""Could I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?"" pic.twitter.com/VrGQw7UzIW — Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) October 23, 2019 Twitter’s opposing policy on political ads also isn’t immune from criticism, as we’ve noted. Indeed, it’s already facing accusations that a total ban is biased against new candidates who start with a lower public profile. Even if the energy of that argument would be better spent advocating for wide-ranging reform of campaign financing, including hard limits on election spending. If you really want to reboot politics by levelling the playing field between candidates that’s how to do it. Also essential: Regulations capable of enforcing controls on dark money to protect democracies from being bought and cooked from the inside via the invisible seeding of propaganda that misappropriates the reach and data of Internet platforms to pass off lies as populist truth, cloaking them in the shape-shifting blur of microtargeted hyperconnectivity. Sketchy interests buying cheap influence from data-rich billionaires, free from accountability or democratic scrutiny, is our new warped ‘normal’. But it shouldn’t be. There’s another issue being papered over here, too. Twitter banning political ads is really a distracting detail when you consider that it’s not a major platform for running political ads anyway. During the 2018 US midterms the category generated less than $3M for the company. Since we are getting questions: This decision was based on principle, not money. As context, we’ve disclosed that political ad spend for the 2018 US midterms was <$3M. There is no change to our Q4 guidance. I am proud to work @twitter! #LoveWhereYouWork https://t.co/U9I0o1woev — Ned Segal (@nedsegal) October 30, 2019 Facebook says Political Ad dollars are less than 0.5% of revenues — based on 2019 consensus revs that is ~$350 million of political ad dollars Twitter has said Political Ad dollars are less than $3 million, which implies about 0.1% of revs based on 2019 consensus $FB $TWTR pic.twitter.com/hjDgSZxolo — Rich Greenfield (@RichLightShed) October 30, 2019 And, secondly, anything posted organically as a tweet to Twitter can act as a political call to arms. Of course in reality the whole of Twitter is a political ad — Natasha (@riptari) October 30, 2019 It’s these outrageous ‘organic’ tweets where the real political action is on Twitter’s platform. (Hi Trump.) Including inauthentically ‘organic’ tweets which aren’t a person’s genuinely held opinion but a planted (and often paid for) fake. Call it ‘going native’ advertising; faux tweets intended to pass off lies as truth, inflated and amplified by bot armies (fake accounts) operating in plain sight (often gaming Twitter’s trending topics) as a parallel ‘unofficial’ advertising infrastructure whose mission is to generate attention-grabbing pantomimes of public opinion to try and sway the real thing. In short: Propaganda. Who needs to pay to run a political ad on Twitter when you can get a bot network to do the boosterism for you? Let’s not forget Dorsey is also the tech CEO famed for not applying his platform’s rules of conduct to the tweets of certain high profile politicians. (Er, Trump again, basically.) So by saying Twitter is banning political ads yet continuing to apply a double standard to world leaders’ tweets — most obviously by allowing the US president to bully, abuse and threaten at will in order to further his populist rightwing political agenda — the company is trying to have its cake and eat it. More recently Twitter has evolved its policy slightly, saying it will apply some limits on the reach of rule-breaking world leader tweets. But it continues to run two sets of rules. To Dorsey’s credit he does foreground this tension in his tweet storm — where he writes [emphasis ours]: Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale. These challenges will affect ALL internet communication, not just political ads. Best to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings. Trying to fix both means fixing neither well, and harms our credibility. This is good stuff from Dorsey. Surprisingly good, given his and Twitter’s long years of free speech fundamentalism — when the company gained a reputation for being wilfully blind and deaf to the fact that for free expression to flourish online it needs a protective shield of civic limits. Otherwise ‘freedom to amplify any awful thing’ becomes a speech chiller that disproportionately harms minorities. Aka freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of reach, as Dorsey now notes. Even with Twitter making some disappointing choices in how it defines political issues, for the purposes of this ad ban, the contrast with Facebook and Zuckerberg — still twisting and spinning in the same hot air; trying to justify incoherent platform policies that sell out democracy for a binary ideology which his own company can’t even stick to — looks stark. The timing of Dorsey’s tweet-storm, during Facebook’s earnings call, was clearly intended to make that point. “Zuckerberg wants us to believe that one must be for or against free speech with no nuance, complexity or cultural specificity, despite running a company that’s drowning in complexity,” writes cultural historian, Siva Vaidhyanathan, confronting Facebook’s moral vacuousness in a recent Guardian article responding to another Zuckerberg ‘manifesto’ on free speech. “He wants our discussions to be as abstract and idealistic as possible. He wants us not to look too closely at Facebook itself.” Facebook’s position on speech does only stand up in the abstract. Just as its ad-targeting business can only run free of moral outrage in unregulated obscurity, where the baked in biases — algorithmic and user generated — are safely hidden from view so people can’t joins the dots on how they’re being damaged. We shouldn’t be surprised at how quickly the scandal-prone company is now being called on its ideological BS. We have a savvier political class as a result of the platform-scale disinformation and global data scandals of the past few years. People who have have seen and experienced what Facebook’s policies translate to in real world practice. Like compromised elections and community violence. British parliament presses Facebook on letting politicians lie in ads With lawmakers like these turning their attention on platform giants there is a genuine possibility of meaningful regulation coming down the pipe for the antisocial media business. Not least because Facebook’s self regulation has always been another piece of crisis PR, designed to preempt and steer off the real thing. It’s a cynical attempt to maintain its profitable grip on our attention. The company has never been committed to making the kind of systemic change necessary to fix its toxic speech issues. The problem is, ultimately, toxicity and division drives engagement, captures attention and makes Facebook a lot of money. Twitter can claim a little distance from that business model not only because it’s considerably less successful than Facebook at generating money by monopolizing attention, but also because it provides greater leeway for its users to build and follow their own interest networks, free from algorithmic interference (though it does do algorithms too). It has also been on a self-proclaimed reform path for some time. Most recently saying it wants to be responsible for promoting “conversational health on its platform. No one would say it’s there yet but perhaps we’re finally getting to see some action. Even if banning political ads is mostly a quick PR win for Twitter. The really hard work continues, though. Namely rooting out bot armies before their malicious propaganda can pollute the public sphere. Twitter hasn’t said it’s close to being able to fix that. Facebook is also still failing to stem the tide of ‘organic’ politicized fake content on its platform. Fakes that profit at our democratic expense by spreading hate and lies. For this type of content Facebook offers no searchable archive (as it now does for paid ads which it defines as political) — thereby providing ongoing cover for dark money to do its manipulative hack-job on democracy by free-posting via groups and pages. Plus, even where Facebook claims to be transparently raising the curtain on paid political influence it’s abjectly failing to do so. Its political ads API is still being blasted by research academics as not fit for purpose. Even as the company policy cranks up pressure on external fact-checkers by giving politicians the green light to run ads that lie. It has also been accused of applying a biased standard when it comes to weeding out “coordinated inauthentic behavior”, as Facebook euphemistically calls the networks of fake accounts set up to amplify and juice reach — when the propaganda in question is coming from within the US and leans toward the political right. Just thinking about how 4,000 advertisers stopped paying Breitbart but then Facebook started paying Breitbart. — Siva Vaidhyanathan🗽🤘🏽 (@sivavaid) October 26, 2019 Facebook denies this, claiming for example that a network of pages on its platform reported to be exclusively boosting content from US conservative news site, The Daily Wire, are “real pages run by real people in the U.S., and they don’t violate our policies“. (It didn’t offer us any detail on how it reached that conclusion.) A company spokesperson also said: “We’re working on more transparency so that in the future people have more information about Pages like these on Facebook.” So it’s still promising ‘more transparency’ — rather than actually being transparent. And it remains the sole judge interpreting and applying policies that aren’t at all legally binding; so sham regulation then. Moreover, while Facebook has at times issued bans on toxic content from certain domestic hate speech preachers’, such as banning some of InfoWars’ Alex Jones’ pages, it’s failed to stop the self-same hate respawning via new pages. Or indeed the same hateful individuals maintaining other accounts on different Facebook-owned social properties. Inconsistency of policy enforcement is Facebook’s DNA. Set against all that Dorsey’s decision to take a stance against political ads looks positively statesmanlike. It is also, at a fundamental level, obviously just the right thing to do. Buying a greater share of attention than you’ve earned politically is regressive because it favors those with the deepest pockets. Though of course Twitter’s stance won’t fix the rest of a broken system where money continues to pour in and pollute politics. We also don’t know the fine-grained detail of how Twitter’s algorithms amplify political speech when it’s packaged in organic tweet form. So whether its algorithmic levers are more likely to be triggered into boosting political tweets that inflame and incite, or those that inform and seek to unite. As I say, the whole of Twitter’s platform can sum to political advertising. And the company does apply algorithms to surface or suppress tweets based on its proprietary (and commercial) determination of ‘engagement quality’. So its entire business is involved in shaping how visible (or otherwise) tweeted speech is. That very obviously includes plenty of political speech. Not for nothing is Twitter Trump’s platform of choice. Nothing about its ban on political ads changes all that. So, as ever, where social media self-regulation is concerned, what we are being given is — at best — just fiddling around the edges. A cynical eye might say Twitter’s ban is intended to distract attention from more structural problems baked into these attention-harvesting Internet platforms. The toxic political discourse problem that democracies and societies around the world are being forced to grapple with is as a consequence of how Internet platforms distribute content and shape public discussion. So what’s really key is how these companies use our information to program what we each get to see. The fact that we’re talking about Twitter’s political ad ban risks distracting from the “root problems” Dorsey referenced in passing. (Though he would probably offer a different definition of their cause. In the tweet storm he just talks about “working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info”.) Facebook’s public diagnosis of the same problem is always extremely basic and blame-shifting. It just says some humans are bad, ergo some bad stuff will be platformed by Facebook — reflecting the issue back at humanity. Here’s an alternative take: The core issue underpinning all these problems around how Internet platforms spread toxic propaganda is the underlying fact of taking people’s data in order to manipulate our attention. This business of microtargeting — or behavioral advertising, as it’s also called — turns everyone into a target for some piece of propaganda or other. It’s a practice that sucks regardless of whether it’s being done to you by Donald Trump or by Disney. Because it’s asymmetrical. It’s disproportionate. It’s exploitative. And it’s inherently anti-democratic. It also incentivizes a pervasive, industrial-scale stockpiling of personal data that’s naturally hostile to privacy, terrible for security and gobbles huge amounts of energy and computing resource. So it sucks from an environmental perspective too. And it does it all for the very basest of purposes. This is platforms selling you out so others can sell you stuff. Be it soap or political opinions. Zuckerberg’s label of choice for this process — “relevant ads” — is just the slick lie told by a billionaire to grease the pipes that suck out the data required to sell our attention down the river. Microtargeting is both awful for the individual (meaning creepy ads; loss of privacy; risk of bias and data misuse) and terrible for society for all the same reasons — as well as grave, society-level risks, such as election interference and the undermining of hard-won democratic institutions by hostile forces. Individual privacy is a common good, akin to public health. Inoculation — against disease or indeed disinformation — helps protect the whole of us from damaging contagion. To be clear, microtargeting is also not only something that happens when platforms are paid money to target ads. Platforms are doing this all the time; applying a weaponizing layer to customize everything they handle. It’s how they distribute and program the masses of information users freely upload, creating maximally engaging order out of the daily human chaos they’ve tasked themselves with turning into a compelling and personalized narrative — without paying a massive army of human editors to do the job. Facebook’s News Feed relies on the same data-driven principles as behavioral ads do to grab and hold attention. As does Twitter’s ‘Top Tweets’ algorithmically ranked view. This is programmed attention-manipulation at vast scale, repackaged as a ‘social’ service. One which uses what the platforms learn by spying on Internet users as divisive glue to bind our individual attention, even if it means setting some of us against each another. That’s why you can publish a Facebook post that mentions a particular political issue and — literally within seconds — attract a violently expressed opposing view from a Facebook ‘friend’ you haven’t spoken to in years. The platform can deliver that content ‘gut punch’ because it has a god-like view of everyone via the prism of their data. Data that powers its algorithms to plug content into “relevant” eyeballs, ranked by highest potential for engagement sparks to fly. It goes without saying that if a real friendship group contained such a game-playing stalker — who had bugged everyone’s phones to snoop and keep tabs on them, and used what they learnt to play friends off against each other — no one would imagine it bringing the group closer together. Yet that’s how Facebook treats its captive eyeballs. That awkward silence you could hear as certain hard-hitting questions struck Zuckerberg during his most recent turn in the House might just be the penny dropping. It finally feels as if lawmakers are getting close to an understanding of the real “root problem” embedded in these content-for-data sociotechnical platforms. Platforms that invite us to gaze into them in order that they can get intimate with us forever — using what they learn from spying to pry further and exploit faster. So while banning political ads sounds nice it’s just a distraction. What we really need to shatter the black mirror platforms are holding against society, in which they get to view us from all angles while preventing us from seeing what they’re doing, is to bring down a comprehensive privacy screen. No targeting against personal data. Let them show us content and ads, sure. They can target this stuff contextually based on a few generic pieces of information. They can even ask us to specify if we’d like to see ads about housing today or consumer packaged goods? We can negotiate the rules. Everything else — what we do on or off the platform, who we talk to, what we look at, where we go, what we say — must remain strictly off limits."

According to the Department of Education, Harvard University has the biggest college endowment in the U.S. with about $37.6 billion. And according to research firm Wealth-X, Harvard also has the highest number of super rich alumni. Each year, Wealth-X identifies the colleges and universities with the highest number of ""ultra high net worth"" (UHNW) alumni, defined as those with a net worth of greater than $30 million. Wealth-X first collects a sample of ultra-wealthy individuals known to have a diploma, including both undergraduate and graduate degrees, from colleges and universities around the world, and tallies their total wealth as a group. Researchers then use this sample and Wealth-X's database to estimate how many super-rich alumni each school has graduated in total.

Even though Harvard tops the list of the most super-rich alumni, the University of Chicago stands out as having the highest percentage of ""self made"" alumni with net worths above $30 million, as opposed to those who have reached this status through inheritance. Wealth-X estimates that 84% of University of Chicago alumni who are worth more than $30 million made their fortunes on their own and 12% were considered self made while also benefiting from substantial inheritance. The remaining 4% of super rich alumni from the University of Chicago were wealthy solely from inheritance. The University of Virginia (UVA) came in second on Wealth-X's measure of super rich self made alumni. Wealth-X estimates that 84% of ultra-wealthy UVA alumni are fully self made, 10% both inherited wealth and are self made and 6% simply inherited wealth. Six of the eight Ivy league schools made the list while only five public universities did. The only two Ivy League schools not to crack the top 20 are Brown University and Dartmouth College. California is home to the highest number of schools on Wealth-X's ranking including Stanford, University of Southern California, UC Berkeley and UCLA."
200," (CNN)If you want to stay on Alex Trebek's good side, try not to do this on ""Jeopardy!"" The game-show host gave an interview to Vulture and touched on what he doesn't love. ""What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with,"" Trebek said. ""Why are they doing that? They're doing themselves a disservice."" He also had some insight as to how to play the game. ""When the show's writers construct categories, they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you'd begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked,"" Trebek said. ""I like there to be order on the show, but as the impartial host I accept disorder."" Trebek sounds as if he would also like some contestants to think bigger. ""I have been disappointed when contestants made conservative wagers because they don't realize the obvious,"" he said. ""And that is, if a clue is in the second box from the top, it's going to be easier than a clue at the bottom of the category. So if you've landed on what should be an easier Daily Double clue, why not take a chance?"" Not that he tries to influence players, he said, but he will make a joke about it. ""You'll hear me say things like, 'You made it a true Daily Double in the first round when you only had a $1,000. Now that you've got $13,000, I'm sure you'll want to make it another true Daily Double,' "" the host said. ""But I'm not seriously suggesting they make that wager."" There was a bit of a panic among fans not too long ago when Trebek's comments during an interview made it sound like he may be retiring. He said the uproar was overblown. ""I don't understand the publicity around it. The same thing happened when I shaved my mustache off in 2001,"" said Trebek, who reportedly renewed his contract with the show through 2022. ""It got so much play. Folks, get a life. There are more important things."" Trebek said he knows his purpose on the show and tries to stick with it. ""The stars of the show are the contestants and the game itself,"" he said. ""That's why I've always insisted that I be introduced as the host and not the star. And if you want to be a good host, you have to figure a way to get the contestants to -- as in the old television commercial about the military -- 'be all you can be.' ""Because if they do well, the show does well,"" Trebek added. ""And if the show does well, by association I do well."" "
201,"Just back from a seven-week recess, the U.S. Senate lost no time in once again dropping the ball on desperately needed funding to combat the Zika epidemic even as the crisis continues to escalate. How to explain this delay? The most obvious reason is a cynical Republican-backed effort to tie Zika funding to restrictions on Planned Parenthood, something that Democrats have predictably refused to go along with. But there is also another less visible culprit that has been with us from the start: improbably calming rhetoric that has slowed the will to act. One example: The tendency of those in the CDC and WHO to speak in terms of personal responsibility — on actions that individuals can take to protect themselves. These include avoiding travel to areas where Zika is prevalent, wearing long sleeves and pants, using bug spray, and practicing safe sex through abstinence or condom use. The implication: if we are just careful enough, we can protect ourselves. This vital information is not even on the front pages of their websites, further suggesting that Zika is not a high priority. Also slowing the response is the fact that Zika has not for the most part been described as a clear and present danger in the United States. Admittedly, the tide could turn with the recent announcement that mosquitoes in Miami Beach have tested positive for the virus, signaling it may pose a growing threat in affluent areas. But to date, the U.S. media has downplayed the dangers of homegrown Zika. We’ve been assured it is limited in scope, and nothing most of us need to worry about. It is a neighborhood problem with its epicenter in the Wynwood area of Miami, a largely Hispanic community with a rich history of Puerto Rican immigration. Not our neighborhood, not our problem. Does this sound familiar? It should. Before AIDS was recognized as a serious health concern in the United States, hundreds of thousands of Africans were infected with the virus. Then, when U.S. cases finally garnered attention, we were reassured that the threat was only to the male gay community — not our “neighborhood.” Then too, we saw a focus on personal responsibility. In 1986, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop released his AIDS report with a plea to abstain from sex, practice monogamy, and use condoms. Travel to Africa was discouraged. Haiti was labeled ground zero for the spread in the United States and travel there discouraged. To be sure, the number of cases in the United States has not reached hundreds of thousands. As of September 1, there were 16,832 reported cases within the U.S. and its territories –2,738 travel related and 14,094 locally acquired primarily in Puerto Rico. How do these numbers compare to the rest of the world? That is difficult to answer because the WHO Situation Reports only tells us that 72 countries are impacted at this time. A total of actual cases is not reported. You can see a map of the world, its spread across the southern region, and read reassurances that Zika has existed in the majority of these countries for years, the people are probably immune and its spread slow. Its impact on the rest of the world is clearly a mystery. Nevertheless, a rather steady increase in both the continental U.S. and its territories is reported daily. In one week, nearly 2,000 new cases were discovered in Puerto Rico. If Zika poses “a hidden threat to future generations of Puerto Ricans” then does it not for all who live in the U.S. and its territories? Even our current Surgeon General, Vivek H. Murthy predicts that 25 percent of Puerto Rico’s population will acquire it by the end of this year. As Americans, we have a tendency to think of Puerto Rico as a foreign country somewhere over there far, far away. But, it is part of US and close. Like that once mysterious virus HIV, which we now realize is associated with a variety of ailments ending with AIDS, we still have a great deal to learn about Zika. We must address this pandemic regardless of its epicenter. Major healthcare organizations must sound the alarm with much more concrete information, and we should all demand that Congress meet to approve the administration’s request of $1.9 billion to seriously deter its spread. It’s time to replace reassuring rhetoric with reassuring action. Darlene K.

203,"Iron Fist might pack a powerful punch, but lately he's been on the receiving end of a critical pummeling. The first reviews for Netflix's latest Marvel superhero show have not been good, to put it mildly. In most normal circumstances, I'd stay the hell away from a series with reviews that bad. But Iron Fist has the Marvel name on it, and I'm a Marvel obsessive. That's how they get you. So when Iron Fist finally hit Netflix this morning after months of loud buzz – some of it good, most of it bad – I fired up my television to give the show a go. The first thing that happened when I sat down to watch Iron Fist was I discovered that Enter the Dragon was playing on HBO (or Cinemax, or one of those other premium cable channels). Bruce Lee is definitely subtweeting me from beyond the grave.  The second thing that happened was that I noticed all the episode titles had these weird bullshit titles meant to sound vaguely ""Asian."" ""Under Leaf Pluck Lotus."" ""Black Tiger Steals Heart."" ""Dragon Plays with Fire.""  We are not off to a good start here.  But it's my job to watch this thing, so I proceed. Here are some thoughts I had while watching the first two episodes, ""Snow Gives Way"" and ""Shadow Hawk Takes Flight."" I am immediately disgusted by Danny, but if they're trying to make me feel sorry for Finn Jones it's working.  Oh, and ""So Fresh, So Clean"" is playing because irony, I guess. I realize later that I should have treasured this joke because it is one of the very few we'll get in the entire series. So Danny beats them all up and makes his way up the elevator. This is horrifying! That receptionist and those guards were just trying to do their jobs, which is to protect the people in the building from creepy weirdos who walk in off the street.  It also makes Iron Fist kinda-sorta a story about white privilege, but not in a good way.  First, it takes a special kind of pampered obliviousness on Danny's part to just assume that every single person in the building will take him at his word that he's the presumed-dead heir to the company. And second, imagine what would happen if literally anyone but a white guy beat up a bunch of security guards to sneak into a Manhattan high-rise in the middle of a work day. There would be lockdowns. Evacuations. Calls to the NYPD.  What there would definitely not be is a bunch of people standing around in the lobby, looking kind of cranky about the whole thing but just kinda shrugging it off.  Danny Rand talks about stuff. I know the Meachums are supposed to be the bad guys of this story, or at least that some of them are, but I've gotta say, I'm #TeamMeachum to start. It's hard to blame these people for being angry and scared that some total stranger has breached security and infiltrated their building and is now spouting nonsense about everyone's dead parents. Guys, I'm starting to think Danny Rand is not a good person. I was told Iron Fist would be a superhero show about Loras Tyrell having magical martial arts powers, but so far it's looking like the story of a nice family and their terrifying stalker. While rooting around Joy Meachum's house, Danny has a flashback to childhood, where he and Joy and Ward Meachum were all sitting around playing a game. In this flashback, Danny, who is about 10, has straight-ish hair with just a slight wave. Is it normal for a straight-haired 10-year-old kid to grow up to become a ramen-haired 25-year-old man? Does this mean the younger version of Danny used to straight iron his hair? Or that the older version of Danny is perming his? I have so many questions. This is actually the most upsetting part of the entire two episodes I watched, but for once it's not Iron Fist's fault. My initial reaction was ""Ha! You done fucked up, show! Danny's been gone for 15 years! Why would he have an iPod??"" Then came the chilling reaction that Danny has an iPod because iPods are over 15 years old. Holy shit, where has the time gone? What have I done with my life? Why am I so old? Have I lived a life of value? Will my next 15 years go by so quickly?  Danny Rand frowns at stuff. Kind of. He's a real dick about it. This guy clearly just wants to help but Danny is amiably condescending toward him and laughs in his face about the notion that the outside world would see the two of them together and assume they're ""pretty much alike."" Later, Danny will quote Buddha at this poor fellow. Anyway, don't get too attached to him, because nothing good happens to him later. What's that about? Is Danny a warg or something? Danny and Colleen have a brief exchange in perfect, relatively unaccented* English, and yet Danny decides that now he is going to start speaking to her in Mandarin. Danny is every white guy who has ever beamed at me with smug satisfaction after mangling a basic greeting to me in whatever he thinks my ""native tongue"" is. (* Finn Jones and Jessica Henwick are both British. His American accent is perfect. Hers is less so.) Colleen shuts that down right away, which I think is the show trying to demonstrate that they totally get it! They do not get it. Danny demands a job at her dojo, and when she refuses, he shows up there later and tries again. He tells her how to run her dojo (""Do you teach kung fu? You probably should, you'd get more students"") and then, I dunno, lectures her about practice swords or something.  Honestly, I kinda tuned out at this point.   Look at these nice people minding their own business. Danny admits he has not driven since he was a small child sitting on his dad's lap and pretending to drive, but slams the accelerator anyway like he's Vin Diesel or something. Ward is understandably terrified and threatens Danny with a gun. Danny grabs the gun, points it back at Ward, and lectures Ward about how Ward was mean to him 15 years ago.  Danny is so hell-bent on proving his identity that it never seems to occur to him that even if he is the real Danny Rand, no one owes him the time of day.  After his exhausting misadventure with Danny, Ward returns home where we learn his dad, whom we had previously learned died several years ago, is still alive. Surprise! Of course, if you recognized character actor David Wenham from Lord of the Rings or Top of the Lake or Lion or Iron Fist's own promotional campaign, you probably could've guessed that already.  Anyway, Dad Meachum is a total irredeemable asshole in a way that makes me feel really sorry for Ward Meachum. It's probably not a good sign for the show that Ward seems like a way more relatable and interesting character than Danny does. The Meachums manage to drug Danny and get him to a mental hospital, where he wakes up at the start of Episode 2. This seems like a reasonable way for them to react to Danny, frankly! For all they know, he's a maniac or a con man trying to cheat them out of their money. (Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention — a lot of the Meachum stuff is boring corporate intrigue.) He's been harassing them at work and at home and even put Ward's life at risk. Why wouldn't they get him committed? Danny, of course, is very put out by this whole thing and starts throwing temper tantrums. This entire show is people reacting sanely to Danny's insane story and Danny beating them up for it.  What a shame this kickass heroine is stuck playing second fiddle to Danny Rand. A bunch of young people on the street attack Colleen while she's going about her day, and she handily takes them all down. It turns out they're not random muggers, but her students, so she gives them some snarky advice. Colleen's moves honestly look way better than anything we've seen Danny do so far. For a martial arts show, the martial arts in this show are not very good. They're just generic fight scenes, and they're slow and clumsy in a way that suggests Finn Jones maybe has not done his homework. Henwick (or her stunt double) moves way more fluidly, and the character has more personality. Can we pull her out of this show and give her and Misty Knight a Daughters of the Dragon spinoff already, please? It is actually amazing how repetitive this show feels just two episodes in. The show's already gotten what feels like hours of mileage out of the one day they shot Child Danny's plane crash scene. The dialogue is mostly people repeating information back at each other. Danny keeps having to convince people over and over that he really is Danny. Et cetera. At one point in the second episode, Ward gets a phone call from his dad, who scolds him for plot exposition reasons. ""He says he is the sworn enemy of The Hand. Do you realize how important that could be?"" yells Father Meachum. Ward kinda just rolls his eyes and responds, ""Not really!""  Ward is me. Side note: In an effort to be sneaky – because, remember, no one's supposed to know Older Meachum is still alive – Ward has his dad listed in his phone as ""Frank N. Stein."" Dude.   Danny Rand punches stuff. He has a really strong fist that glows. It sounds stupid and it looks stupider. Incidentally, this comes after a long talk with Danny and the psychiatrist in which the doc notes that ""Ever since the incident, I'm seeing a lot more people who honestly believe they have superpowers."" I'd kind of like to see this guy's story. Does he ever believe these patients, or does he just spend all his time unintentionally gaslighting them? If he doesn't believe them, why not? He lives in a world where the existence of Captain America, the Hulk, and Luke Cage are public knowledge! Why wouldn't people have superpowers? I mean, I think I know why – if you're gonna have Luke Cage, the comic book fans are gonna demand Iron Fist. But in all other respects, he's an odd fit for this gritty little corner of the MCU. Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage are all ground-level heroes with moderate goals, dealing with immediate and personal threats. They've got powers, but they're worried about paying the bills or dealing with obnoxious neighbors or getting caught up in awkward entanglements. Meanwhile, Iron Fist is the rightful heir of a billion-dollar fortune who has actual magic powers. Not only does he stick out like a sore thumb, his story feels mind-numbingly familiar. He's Tony Stark minus the charisma, Stephen Strange minus the brilliance. Why is he here? Danny Rand wants people to understand he's Danny Rand. He feels obligated to protect the world from The Hand, or something. And ... that's about all I understand of his driving motivation here. I shouldn't be wondering what the point of this entire series is, two episodes in. When Marvel TV first got into business with Netflix, they announced they were making five shows: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and The Defenders. The first three of those have all been good enough that the prospect of a Defenders team-up down the line sounded intriguing and exciting.  But Iron Fist is the franchise's first real misfire. It's boring and repetitive and poorly cast. I'm a lot less excited about seeing this character return. It's clear Netflix is setting us up for an Iron Fist / Luke Cage partnership of some sort, since the characters are BFFs in the comics – but it's honestly difficult to imagine what this version of Luke Cage could possibly want with this version of Iron Fist. And don't even get me started on the queasy possibility of a comics-accurate Iron Fist / Misty Knight romantic pairing.  It's too late for The Defenders to do anything about this, since shooting on that series has been going on for months already. To be clear, I still think The Defenders will be fun. But Iron Fist should prove an interesting test case about the downside of Marvel's meticulously planned, hyper-connected approach to franchise-building.  Can they pivot, or are we stuck proceeding with whatever grandiose plans they had for Iron Fist before he turned out to be a dud? "

205,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has announced plans to cancel all routine surgery for three months and to send home as many patients as possible to free up staff and beds to deal with the spread of the coronavirus. Simon Stevens, NHS head in England, said non-urgent operations will be canceled from April 15 with the aim of freeing up a third of 100,000 hospital beds in England. The goal is to try to stop the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed during a potential surge of coronavirus cases, while at the same time limiting exposure of healthy individuals to the infectious virus. “As part of our readiness for the likely influx of more coronavirus patients, we are going to be taking concerted action,” Stevens told a parliamentary committee. “First of all we are suspending elective non-urgent surgery with an assumption that will be suspended everywhere from 15th April at the latest for at least three months, with a discretion for hospitals to take action earlier if they need it.” On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced what he called the most far-reaching measures the population has experienced in peacetime to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

206," (CNN)A virtual shooting death in an online video game led to the real-life shooting death of a Kansas man in December, according to court documents. Tyler Barriss, 25, was charged with involuntary manslaughter earlier this month for his alleged role in a ""swatting"" incident that ended with Wichita Police fatally shooting 28-year-old Andrew Finch at his front door.  Barriss, who lives in Los Angeles, admitted to placing a prank call reporting a hostage situation at Finch's address, according to a police affidavit. Barriss told police he made call at the request of a gamer who was upset at a teammate for accidentally killing him in a video game. Finch was not involved in the online dispute, and his family said he did not play video games. Barriss has not yet entered a plea. His lawyer, Brad Sylvester, declined to comment on the affidavit's details. However, he said the unique circumstances raise plenty of ""unusual"" questions about legal culpability. ""The way it is tried and the outcome will likely set a precedent for how future similar cases are charged,"" he said in an email. The affidavit provides the most complete timeline to date of the December 28 shooting. This is what it says about how the incident unfolded:  Gamer issues call for swatting  A member of the online gaming community told CNN that the dispute stemmed from a muti-player session of ""Call of Duty: WWII,"" a shooting game that emulates combat from a soldier's point of view. The source did not want to give his name for fear of reprisal. Barriss was not involved in the game but investigators identified two participants. One of them, a gamer in Ohio identified by his Twitter name Baperize, was upset when a teammate in Wichita killed him, according to the affidavit. As Baperize was ""talking trash"" to the Wichita gamer, identified in his affidavit by his initials SG, someone posted Baperize's name and information on Twitter.  In turn, Baperize threatened to swat SG. ""Please try some s--t,"" SG responded and posted Finch's address, the affidavit states. It's not clear why SG selected Finch's address.  As another person claiming to be involved in the game told Wichita police, ""the person gave the wrong address."" Investigators were contacted by several people who said they saw conversations between Baperize and another Twitter user, SWAuTistic. Barriss later told police the account is his. Caller reports a hostage situation Around 6:18 p.m., Sedgwick County dispatch notified Wichita Police of a shooting and possible hostage situation at Finch's address. Dispatchers reported that the caller said he ""shot his dad in the head and that he was not breathing.""  Furthermore, dispatchers told police, the caller said ""he was holding his mom and brother at gunpoint"" and ""he wants to kill himself and light the house on fire."" Police swarm the home and shoot Finch Wichita Police officers arrived at the house around 6:23 p.m. and surrounded the residence.  The affidavit says little about the actual shooting, except for this: ""Officers observed movement in the residence and began to approach, when an adult male from the residence was shot by Wichita Police at or around 1828 hours (6:28 p.m.).""  Police shot Finch after he moved his hands to his waistline, Wichita police Deputy Chief Troy Livingston said in December.  ""Our officers came here preparing for a hostage situation,"" he said. ""Several got in position. A male came to the front door, and one of our officers discharged his weapon."" The calls keep coming in Meanwhile, dispatch was still providing information from the caller to investigators at the scene, the affidavit says. The caller repeated he had his brother and mom in a closet in the back of the house. He was pointing a gun at them and ""he is not going to put the gun away,"" dispatch told police. ""The calling party stated he had poured gasoline all over the house and is thinking about lighting it,"" the affidavit says.  At 6:46 p.m., ""dispatch stated they were no longer in communication with the calling party."" The house is cleared and the victim is declared dead Officers cleared the residence, looking for hostages and found several people inside. ""None of them reported being hostages,"" the affidavit says. No one was found dead, either. Finch was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead at 7:03 p.m. His family sued the city of Wichita and the police department over his death. ""While the swatter should be held accountable, this case is about the City of Wichita and a police department with a history, pattern and practice of using excessive and lethal force against civilians,"" said Andrew M. Stroth, the family's attorney.  ""In the sanctity of his own home, Andy Finch was shot and killed and now two small children don't have a father.""  The city said it would respond to the lawsuit after it had been served. The Sedgwick County District Attorney's Office is reviewing the investigation, and the police department has promised a thorough internal review. ""The City of Wichita and WPD officials have great sympathy for those impacted by the reckless behavior exemplified by  'swatting' which created the circumstances which resulted in this death."" Twitter leads to suspect After the shooting, investigators found references to the incident posted from multiple Twitter accounts, including Baperizer's and one belonging to Barriss under the handle @SWAuTistic.  ""That kid's house I swatted is on the news,"" the affidavit quotes Barriss saying on Twitter. Later, he would say, ""I didn't get anyone killed because I didn't discharge a weapon and being a swat member isn't my profession."" Investigators then learned that Baperizer, also known by his initials, CV, is a suspect in swatting incidents in the Cincinnati area, according to the affidavit.   As for Barriss, DMV records indicate his last known address as a homeless shelter in Los Angeles, the affidavit says. He was living there when police took him into custody on December 29 and interviewed him.  The suspect confesses, according to police Barriss is no stranger to swatting. He told police that he has swatted about 20 homes and evacuated close to 30. He said he does it for the attention, according to the affidavit.  Barriss said ""Bape"" asked him to swat a guy by the name of SG and gave him the address he used to make the call. Barriss said he went to a library and made two calls to law enforcement in Kansas, one using the library Wi-Fi and another using a VPN. In his police interview, he shared the following script: ""I killed my dad because my mom and dad were arguing, killed my dad, now my mom and my little brother are in the closet now and I'm aiming a gun at them in the closet."" About an hour later, he learned that someone had died, he told police. He admitted to posting on Twitter that he was responsible. Weeks later, in an interview from jail, Barriss said he wished none of it ever happened. ""I never intended for anyone to get shot and killed,"" he told CNN affiliate KABC. ""I just wish I could have rewound somehow and just never done it."" CNN's Deanna Hackney and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report."
207,"DUBAI, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received a phone call on Friday from Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, state media from both countries reported, in what could be a breakthrough in the dispute between Doha and neighboring Arab states. “During the call, the Emir of Qatar expressed his desire to sit at the dialogue table and discuss the demands of the four countries to ensure the interests of all,” Saudi state news agency SPA reported. “The details will be announced later after the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia concludes an understanding with the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Arab Republic of Egypt,” SPA reported.

208,"Washington  (CNN)A federal appeals court on Wednesday granted a Trump administration request to expedite oral arguments in a case challenging the legality of the Affordable Care Act.   The new time frame -- with arguments in early July -- means that the fate of Obamacare could come before the Supreme Court next term, with an opinion rendered by June of 2020 in the heart of the presidential campaign. As in 2016 and the 2018 midterms, health care has already emerged as a core issue, though there are fissures in both parties. Congressional Democrats have rallied around Obamacare, while some of the party's presidential nominees are supporting ""Medicare for All"" plans that would offer universal, government-backed health coverage.  President Donald Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on repealing the law, has promised that Republicans will pass a ""really great"" health care plan after the 2020 election, although none has been proposed. The administration last month sided with Republican-led states that are pushing for the law to be invalidated by the courts.   Attorney General William Barr said Wednesday he believes the Justice Department's decision not to argue in favor of upholding the Affordable Care Act is a ""defensible legal position to take.""  Initially, the Trump administration argued that two key provisions of the law that protect people with pre-existing conditions could no longer be defended, but the rest of the law could stand. But after a district court ruled in December 2018 that the entire law should be invalidated, the Justice Department changed its position and argues the district court ruling should be upheld in full. As the administration debated its litigation strategy, Barr at first opposed to fully striking down the law. On Wednesday, he suggested that he is ready to back the administration's position.  When California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein pressed on why Barr, as attorney general, didn't think it was his ""duty to defend"" the current law, Barr doubled down. ""Well, the law was originally upheld because the (individual) mandate was upheld as a tax,"" Barr said of the 2012 Supreme Court decision that upheld the law.  ""Once the penalty was removed, the financial penalty was removed, that provision could no longer be justified as a tax which means that it would have to fall. So the mandate fell,"" he added, referring to Congress' decision in 2017 to effectively remove the penalty for not having insurance. ""Then the question becomes if the mandate falls, even though there was no penalty attached to it, what's its impact on the rest of the statute? Four of the justices in the (2012 case) felt that the whole statute had to fall. So, as I said before you arrived, senator, you know at the end of the day, I felt that this was defensible legal position to take."" RELATED: The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare Feinstein also pressed Barr on who in the administration changed its stance. ""Is this determined by the White House?"" she asked. Barr said that it was ""determined by the process within the executive branch"" and a ""number of different players."" ""Well, I assume you wouldn't take this position unless this is what the President wanted,"" Feinstein added. ""Well -- that would be a safe assumption,"" Barr said. The administration's latest court filing came after months of heated internal debate that pitted Barr along with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar against acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and officials aligned with him, a source close to the White House told CNN at the time.  Overturning the law would have far-reaching consequences -- way beyond disrupting coverage for the millions of people who get their health insurance on the exchanges or through Medicaid expansion. Obamacare saves senior citizens money on their Medicare coverage and prescription drugs. It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. And it allows children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they turn 26.  Because the Trump administration is no longer defending the law in court, a coalition of 21 Democratic states led by California has stepped in to do so. ""Before the ACA, 133 million Americans faced barriers to coverage because of a pre-existing condition like diabetes or pregnancy -- yes, pregnancy,"" California's Attorney General Becerra said in a statement on Wednesday.   ""We will be in court defending Americans' healthcare that President Trump seeks to strip from them, "" he added. Barr's comments on Wednesday came after he faced a similar grilling from members of the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday on the new decision. At one point during the hearing, he told Rep.

212,"The backdrop to President Donald Trump’s recent visit to India was eerily disquieting and strikingly dissonant — presidential pleasantries exchanged in almost a Shakespearean contrast to the religiously driven rioting just miles away. As both an Indian and an American, I have never been more heartbroken than I was to hear of President Trump’s endorsement of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies on “religious freedom.” In India, the worst of history may be repeating itself. The first time was the 1947 partition — the largest mass migration in history. India and Pakistan were delivered by cesarean at the hands of the British, and the incision left 20 million displaced and over 1 million lives lost. This wound remains raw in the institutional memories of our families. Recent events in India have led to tensions perhaps equally seething.  In August, Prime Minister Modi revoked articles in India's constitution that had provided autonomous status to the Muslim majority region of Jammu and Kashmir and that had given Kashmiris the right to legal self-determination and permanent residency. Done under the veil of economic development, this revocation was accompanied by well-documented internet and telecommunication blackouts, mass detentions and widespread beatings and extrajudicial killings, as well as the addition of nearly 40,000 Indian troops in what was already the world’s most militarized zone.   The same month, the Indian government implemented a National Registry of Citizens in the northeastern state of Assam, effectively rendering two million people, mostly Muslims, as stateless. The final insult came in December when India's Parliament approved the Citizenship Amendment Act, which provides undocumented migrants of certain religious minorities a pathway to citizenship but notably excludes Muslims. Millions of Indians now fear they will be targeted for mass detention or deportation. In the history of modern India, this legislation has been the first to explicitly target a religious minority, a sea change in India’s standing as a secular democracy.   What is perhaps equally abhorrent as this lack of regard for human rights and international law by the world’s largest democracy, is the global community’s anemic response — exemplified by the pomp and circumstance of Trump’s visit.  In 2014, in the months following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the United States along with allied partners enacted crippling sanctions on Russia, limiting access to Western markets, enacting export embargoes and freezing assets of key personnel.  In stark contrast, in the months following India's effective annexation of Kashmir, Modi has continued to be received with international fanfare. In September, he joined Trump at a massive rally in Houston, Texas. The same week, Modi received a prestigious award from Bill Gates on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and announced joint initiatives in financial services at the Bloomberg Business Forum. The U.S. Congress has opened public hearings on Kashmir, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights has harshly criticized India’s actions -- yet, there has been no overt diplomatic or economic reprimand of India. While India is a trusted U.S. ally, I believe it runs counter to our own self-interest to maintain double standards around issues of international law, human rights and religious freedom. Clearly, much more can be done.  Rather than offer public praise for Modi’s policies, the Trump administration should consider bold action, including the prospect of economic sanctions leveraging the $142 billion bilateral trade relationship, which would prove timely during a sluggish period for the Indian economy and which has support from a federal bipartisan foreign policy commission.  On the private-sector side, foreign investors should temper their enthusiasm for India. What’s problematic is the complete disconnect between a country’s record on human rights and foreign direct investment. If Modi’s presence at the Bloomberg Forum was suggestive of anything, it was that there will be even further business ties with the U.S. corporate sector. The U.S.-India Business Council, a coalition of roughly 250 of the largest businesses operating in both the U.S. and India, has notably remained mum on the issue of Kashmir, Assam and assaults on religious freedom. How symbolically powerful would it be if council members reminded Modi that the business sector stands for international law and human rights.  India is not only the world’s largest democracy but also the world’s youngest, most plural democracy, with 600 million people under the age of 25. I can’t help but think about 2050, as this generation comes of age, when India will be home to the world’s largest Muslim population, which now feels its home is in jeopardy.  If India won’t honor the pluralism that comes with an inclusive, multicultural democracy, the U.S. and others should do more to safeguard these norms. The wounds of partition are only now healing, and it would be a grave mistake to reopen them.

216,"The title character in “Truman” is a dog, but this film’s director, Cesc Gay, does not excessively exploit him for cheap sentiment. Given the film’s story — about Julián (Ricardo Darín), an actor dying of cancer in Madrid, and Tomás, an old friend (Javier Cámara) who visits him for four days — it must have been tempting. This well-made, low-key drama, written by Mr. Gay and Tomàs Aragay, offers some insights into terminal illness. Julián, a hacking, aging voluptuary, chastises a couple he knows for avoiding him in public because of their inability to face his illness. And he apologizes to a longtime acquaintance, whose wife he once seduced, for causing his divorce. Certainly, Julián, played with grizzled authority by Mr. Darín, is no saint: Visiting his son, Nico (Oriol Pla), who attends college in Amsterdam, he tries to hide the extent of his condition, only to learn afterward that his ex-wife had already informed Nico of it. The through line here is Julián’s attempt to find a home for Truman, his beloved bull mastiff. Again, mawkishness is largely sidestepped. But “Truman” has a different flaw: its insistence on excusing tired standards of machismo, however understated. The friend victimized by Julián’s affair with his wife? He is happily remarried to a much younger woman, now pregnant. The quietly supportive Tomás can express his grief over Julián’s coming demise only while in bed with Julián’s cousin, Paula (Dolores Fonzi), after making love — that is, by cheating on his own wife. There is sensitivity in “Truman,” but only so much. An earlier version of this review misspelled the name of the character played by Dolores Fonzi. She is Paula, not Paola. Because of mistaken information provided by a publicist, the review also misstated Paula’s relation to Julián. She is his cousin, not his sister."
217,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy last year, is now “lean and mean and ready to get to work” on its projects to build nuclear reactors in India, U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry said on Tuesday. The show of support by Perry came after Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse’s bankruptcy filing had raised doubts about the proposed construction of six nuclear reactors in India’s Andhra Pradesh state. The agreement to build reactors, announced in 2016, was the result of a decade of diplomatic efforts as part of a U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement signed in 2008. “Nobody in the world makes better reactors than Westinghouse,” Perry told journalists after a meeting with India’s oil and gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan in New Delhi. “They had some challenges in the past from its business practices. We leave that where it is. The bottom line is, that’s all behind them. They are lean and mean and ready to get to the work.” Westinghouse, owned by Japan’s Toshiba Corp (6502.T) which is to be bought by a unit of Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) (BAM.N), is one of the world’s leading suppliers of nuclear fuel and provides some form of service to 80 percent of the world’s 450 commercial reactors. Perry and Pradhan released a joint statement to “reaffirm their strong commitment to early and full implementation of our civil nuclear partnership, including the Westinghouse civil nuclear project”. They also said the two countries would deepen cooperation on oil and gas, power, renewable energy and coal. “In keeping with the shared objectives to provide a stronger business orientation to our energy cooperation, both sides noted with appreciation the growing investment of Indian companies in the United States and the beginning of oil and gas exports from the United States to India,” they said in the statement. The United States under President Donald Trump has been looking to sell more energy products to India, the world’s third-biggest buyer of oil. Pradhan said India wants to buy more U.S. crude oil “subject to reasonable pricing”. New Delhi has also sought U.S. companies’ participation in India’s strategic petroleum reserves.

218,"The global economy has to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest. Ms. Figueres was executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As young climate activists, frightened for their futures, meet with world leaders at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on Monday, oil and gas industry executives are conferring to grapple with the stark, existential choice their industry faces. As they attended a cocktail reception at the Gramercy Park Hotel Sunday, several dozen climate protesters gathered outside. In some countries, like Britain and the United States, natural gas together with renewables is displacing coal. But the oil and gas industry overall faces a tough road ahead. The global economy must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. This is not a dream or an ideology. It is an imperative. The consequences of not reaching that goal are so threatening to life on this planet that we cannot even contemplate the possibility of failure. And yet oil and gas companies plan to spend $50 billion to extract new reserves of fossil fuels. That expenditure ignores the inevitable reality of the carbon-constrained future already underway. The shelf life of these companies in their current form may be more than five years — but is certainly no more than 30. Roughly one third of global oil demand is estimated to come from cars, which we need to electrify within the next 10 to 15 years. And natural gas, currently playing a major role in power generation, faces increasing competition from renewables, which have a predictable marginal cost: zero. They also have zero emissions and rising public demand for them, and will soon be buttressed by their own competitive battery storage capacity. Markets have started their flight not only from coal, but also from oil and gas. Only one oil company, Exxon Mobil, is among the ten most valuable global companies by market capitalization. FTSE Russell recently reclassified oil and gas companies on the London Stock Exchange as “nonrenewable.” This matters because investors use the FTSE classifications to determine whether to divest from certain polluter stocks. The giant Norwegian sovereign wealth fund recently agreed to dump an estimated $5.7 billion in oil and gas investments. The European Investment Bank — the world’s largest multilateral lender and the biggest provider of climate finance — has proposed ending the financing of fossil fuel infrastructure, including for gas, after 2020. And a $20 billion Danish pension fund is removing the top 10 major oil companies from its portfolio because their long-term business models are incompatible with the Paris climate agreement. Another threat to the oil and gas industry is the negative stigma that has made it unattractive as a career choice for many young people. Any industry depends on fresh thinking and new capacities, and oil and gas may find it increasingly difficult to attract or retain that vital asset. Unless the industry can reinvent itself quickly it may follow the path of electric utilities. They failed to appreciate the depth and speed of the energy transition; now they find themselves struggling. The global climate strikes and the Climate Action Summit make this an auspicious moment for the oil and gas industry’s Climate Initiative to lead the transition of their industry. If it is to continue beyond 2050, it can no longer be an emitter of greenhouse gases or sell products that are. In the short term, oil and gas companies must prove their commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050. To do so, they should eliminate methane emissions and withdraw from direct or indirect lobbying efforts against climate change regulation. The industry must also stop building new capacity and instead finance substantial reforestation around the world. Planting billions of trees is one way to tackle the climate crisis. The world’s forestland can expand by nearly a third — an area roughly the size of the United States — without affecting cities or agriculture. At the same time, leadership by governments is critical. As the industry prepares itself for the low-carbon world by investing in clean innovation and retraining workforces, governments must set the long-term path. Some governments already have concrete plans, but many more must do likewise. Those plans will need to ensure that the price of fossil fuels reflects their true cost for the planet and society, which means ending fossil fuel subsidies and taxing pollution. New training and educational programs are also essential for workers as the industry transitions to a cleaner future. We need to unite behind the science that tells us the world is warming dangerously from the burning of fossil fuels and put the carbon back where it belongs: in biomass and in the soil.

221,"In the first year of his presidency, President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE signed the Women, Peace and Security Act into law. This important bipartisan legislation recognizes that including women in conflict prevention and resolution will promote more inclusive and democratic societies. It’s in the interest of the United States and in the interest of the world. This legislation is the first of its kind globally, making the United States the first country with a law addressing women, peace and security. Just this past week, the Trump administration delivered the first government strategy that will direct how the United States government will implement the law and empower women around the world before, during and after conflict. The need for and promise of this effort is evident when considering countries like Afghanistan, where the United States has been working closely with the government there for almost two decades, since the Taliban was toppled, to make progress on behalf of women. Since the Taliban government fell, millions of Afghan women have voted in local and national elections. For years, these women have played a role seeking to end the conflict. In 2002, the United States Afghan Women’s Council (USAWC) was created as a Presidential Initiative under President George W. Bush. This effort was a joint U.S.-Afghan effort to promote public-private partnerships and mobilize resources to ensure that women can gain the skills and economic opportunities they had been deprived of under the Taliban. The work of the USAWC has flourished through the years and is a concrete example of progress that is possible when the United States invests in women abroad. A case in point is the Afghan Fulbright Program. This educational program offers grants to qualified Afghan graduate students to study at the graduate level in the United States. In 2002, there were no women qualified to apply, due to years of being denied access to education. Today, half the applicants are women and the Afghan Fulbright Program is one of the largest in the world. In fact, Afghan Ambassador to the United States Roya Rahmani (and the first female) is a Fulbright alumnus.  Efforts to include women in the peace process isn’t just a feel good, diversity effort. History has shown that women’s participation in peace processes increases the likelihood of success in reaching agreements and the subsequent longevity of those agreements. According to studies conducted by the United Nations, when women have a substantive role in peace negotiations the likelihood the agreement will last beyond fifteen years increases by as much as 35 percent. That’s why it is within the national interest of the United States to ensure the participation of women in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and a true demonstration of our global leadership. It isn’t always easy; we have recently seen women being excluded from the peace talks in Doha. Many Afghan women have expressed concerns that a U.S.-Taliban peace deal could jeopardize the rights and freedoms they have enjoyed these past eighteen years. There is fear the rights of women could be bargained away. This ongoing peace process in Afghanistan will be a real test of the commitment we make to women around the world. It will be evidence of how seriously we will implement the new Women, Peace and Security Government Strategy. We know women are essential to the development of open and prosperous societies. When we invest in women, and promote their economic empowerment and right to equal treatment under the law, we are promoting peace and stability and changing the very nature of society.  Let’s stand strong with the women of Afghanistan.  Andrea Bottner is a senior advisor to Independent Women's Forum, on the Women, Peace and Security Act.  View the discussion thread.

222,"A look at the political math in six states where tight races could determine control of the Senate: NORTH CAROLINA Senator Richard Burr, a Republican, was thought to be a safe bet for re-election against Deborah Ross, his Democratic challenger, who is a former state representative and head of the state’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. But North Carolina has been roiled by a fight over bathroom rights for transgender people that has affected almost every campaign. The national Republican Party has swooped in to try to save Mr. Burr’s bid. _____ PENNSYLVANIA Katie McGinty, a Democrat, is trying to become Pennsylvania’s first female senator with a bid to unseat Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican who has managed to keep a moderate image around the state because of a (failed) gun safety bill that bore his name. Hillary Clinton’s coattails — and Donald J. Trump’s anvil — have made a difference here. _____ NEW HAMPSHIRE Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, is suffering from an uncomfortable association with Mr. Trump, most notably when she had to release a statement walking back her suggestion during a debate that Mr. Trump was a role model for children. Gov. Maggie Hassan, her Democratic challenger, is getting major assistance from national party figures like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders in what is widely viewed as the closest Senate race in the country. _____ MISSOURI Senator Roy D. Blunt was on no lists of endangered incumbents. Then his Democratic challenger, Jason Kander, an Afghanistan veteran who is Missouri’s secretary of state, conjured up an ad in which he assembled an assault rifle blindfolded while speaking of gun rights. It was a clever way to both fend off attacks over gun control and underscore Mr. Blunt’s Vietnam deferments in a very pro-military state. Mr. Blunt’s decades of service in Washington are also out of style this year. _____ INDIANA Evan Bayh, a Democrat, is trying to reclaim his Senate seat but is finding that his time as a Washington insider is a serious liability. Representative Todd Young, with the help of millions of dollars in outside money, is painting a dark picture of Mr. Bayh as a greedy lobbyist who abandoned his voters, and Mr. Bayh’s double-digit lead has shrunk significantly. Indiana is Trump country, and Mr. Bayh, who was once a very popular governor, is going to need Republican voters who remember him fondly to split their tickets. _____ NEVADA For a while, it did not seem that Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who is a former state attorney general, would catch up to Representative Joe Heck, a Republican who seemed a good fit for his state and this cycle. But Mr. Heck, by turning away from Mr. Trump after the presidential candidate was heard bragging about sexual assault in a 2005 recording, began to lose some of his base support, living every Republican candidate’s nightmare. The Hispanic vote, important here, is hard to poll. But Ms. Cortez Masto is now narrowly ahead in the race, a battle for the seat of Senator Harry Reid in which the retiring Democratic leader has unleashed his political machine in support of her."
223,"Former Vice President Joe Biden's grip on Democratic presidential primary polling has loosened in recent weeks as surveys show tight races in key early nominating contests. Since he entered the jammed race to challenge President Donald Trump in April, Biden has enjoyed an edge in early surveys nationwide and in the pivotal states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. His standing as the clear front-runner has dissolved with a little over three months remaining until the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus, according to polling averages. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has steadily climbed in national surveys to a point where she sits fewer than 5 percentage points behind Biden in a RealClearPolitics average. Meanwhile, polls show Biden jockeying for position with Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the early voting states. Even as he faces increased competition in other key states, polls have consistently found a massive lead for Biden in the fourth Democratic nominating state of South Carolina. While national surveys help to gauge candidates' overall standing, state polls provide a better picture of voter sentiment in places where voters will actually decide on candidates in the coming months. The dynamics of the race could change significantly between now and early February, when the Democratic nominating contests will start. Here's where the polling averages stand currently at the national level and in the first four nominating states. The top 10 candidates in the primary field of 19 are listed. Other candidates at least tying for a top 10 spot in a national or early state polling average are Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; entrepreneur Andrew Yang; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; activist Tom Steyer; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and author Marianne Williamson."

227,"Valhalla, New York (CNN)Nicole McDonald eases her silver minivan across Bear Mountain Bridge and hooks a right onto the steep two-lane highway.  The road twists like a snake up the mountainous incline, an old route where the road's edge blends into beautiful greenery and perilous cliffs overlook the Hudson River. Where your knuckles turn white from clutching the steering wheel and a knot grows in your belly.   Nicole makes this trip every day from her home in upstate New York to see her twin sons, Jadon and Anias. The 21-month-old boys are at Blythedale Children's Hospital 40 miles to the south, where they've been undergoing rehabilitation since mid-December. The twins, born joined at the head, captured the world's attention after a marathon surgery to separate them last fall. The journey to go see them, Nicole says, is similar to the one her boys have been through: setbacks and victories, nerve-wracking and awe-inspiring.  ""It's like climbing a mountain,"" she says, ""and you get to the place you thought was the top only to realize you have another mile to go and you don't have the supplies for it."" She thinks back to a moment weeks earlier when she reached a breaking point. Jadon and Anias had been sick off and on for nearly a month. Her other child, 3-year-old Aza, battled high fevers and croup. Amid it all, Mom got sick.  But after a few days, finally, it seemed everyone was healthy. Nicole visited the boys at the rehabilitation center. Jadon fell asleep in his crib, and she worked to put Anias down. He was laughing, but in an instant, he unleashed a scream and vomited. Again and again, until nothing was left. Nicole stood, drenched in vomit, and held her 25-pound boy for more than six hours. Then, Jadon awoke, ""just puking nonstop."" She wondered why, after everything her boys have gone through, they couldn't seem to catch a break.  In that moment, she closed her eyes. ""I quit,"" she thought. ""I can't do this anymore."" Seconds later, though, she snapped back. Amid the desperate exhaustion, she found strength. She became more focused, more determined, more resilient. Her boys needed her. Her family needed her.  She didn't sleep for two days, tending to their every need.  A physical therapist by training, she learned that she could rely on her instincts -- and that no matter what was thrown at her, she was strong enough to take it. ""My 'I quit' moment shoved me into the mindset of 'I can do this,' "" she says. ""Not only can I handle it, I can handle it on my own. It was about being free, even though it's hard."" She took that moment almost like a rallying cry for her boys. And she found it both exhilarating and rewarding: ""I can be their mom without some nurse coming in every two seconds. Eventually, I'm going to have to do this at home. It was proof for me in that 'I quit' moment that I can."" What drives her is the sheer joy that spreads across her boys' faces when she enters their room. Most of all, she just wants to bring them home. She mashes the accelerator on the road to see her boys. 'Just trying to survive' Christian McDonald climbs the extension ladder and rips rotted wall studs from the outside of the family's split-level ranch house. His shirt is peeled off, and sweat drips from his chin.  While Nicole works with the boys, Christian works to ready their newly purchased home for the twins' return. The work has allowed the former truck driver to return to his blue-collar roots. Knocking down walls and ripping up siding has been good for his soul, a way to relieve the stress of dealing with everything Jadon and Anias have gone through.  The wood-shingled house, nestled in Orange County with views of the Catskill Mountains, is the family's third home in less than two years.  In February 2016, they transported their lives from small-town Illinois to the Bronx to be near the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, where the twins' surgery took place. They lived in a rental home for more than a year. Once the twins were moved to rehab at Blythedale, in Valhalla, the family moved too -- in part to get away from the hectic pace of the city.  The house, which had been a foreclosure, is in need of what a real estate agent might call ""a little TLC."" The stairs leading up to the front door have been demolished -- one of many projects on Christian's to-do list. He's refinished one bathroom, turning it into showroom quality.  Nicole and Christian hope to flip the home eventually; they say they wouldn't have been able to afford it if not for strangers who donated more than $330,000 on their GoFundMe page.  Neither parent has been able to work since their journey to New York began. ""We're just trying to survive, really,"" says Nicole, ""and this is how we're trying to survive."" Christian says he doesn't quite understand why so many people have found inspiration in their story. In his view, he and Nicole are just regular folks going through an ordeal, not too much different from other families with sick children. He's grateful and thankful not just for the donations but for all the messages of support.  Nicole draws inspiration from them, too. She holds one note especially close, written by a woman who said she had planned to commit suicide until she read about the McDonalds' struggle and found hope in their story.  Even with the ongoing renovations, their home feels warm and inviting. The message on one living room wall reads ""Live, Laugh, Love."" On the other, ""Peace, Love, Dream."" Collages of photographs show the boys from before and after the 27-hour surgery in mid-October. The McDonalds gave CNN exclusive access to the surgery and allowed us to follow them in the months since. Their story will be featured in an hour-long special, ""Separated: Saving the Twins,"" hosted by CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Friday night at 10 ET.  Much has changed since the surgery.  Although it might have been the most difficult medical task, the parents knew what to expect. The doctors essentially gave them a road map of the procedure and the care that would follow. Emotionally, they were prepared.  But rehab has been different: filled with sick boys, constant worry and extreme ups and downs. While the care has been great, the parents say, there was just no way to be prepared for the various health scares.    ""Every day is a new day with a new challenge,"" Nicole says. ""It has literally been the journey of sickness for the last couple months."" One night, a feverish Anias suffered a lengthy seizure and stopped breathing when his temperature rose too high, too fast. Two fluid-filled cysts have emerged on the top of his scalp, doubling his head's normal weight. He had to have his skull cap removed due to infection and will undergo another surgery when he is 7 to insert bone.   Jadon has battled infection, too. Dissolvable plates that were inserted during the surgery have pushed up through his scalp. ""I pull out pieces of plate from his head,"" Nicole says, ""and every day, it breaks my heart.""  Anias has struggled the most, both before and after the surgery. When they were joined at the head, Jadon was more dominant, his body working overtime to keep Anias alive.  The boys were 13 months old when they were separated. Developmentally, the surgery set them back to infancy. They've had to learn how to use muscles they never knew they had. Jadon has progressed largely on track; like a 9-month-old, he is almost crawling. Anias is beginning to hold his head up, more like a 5-month-old, his mother says. Anias also has limited mobility on the right side of his body and must be fed via a tube. When he has a cold, his nose becomes so stuffed that he struggles to breathe, waking about every 10 minutes crying. ""It's awful,"" his mother says. Despite the struggle, Mom and Dad say they have no regrets about going through with the surgery. Studies have shown that 80% of twins joined at the head, called craniopagus twins, die of medical complications by the age of 2 if not separated.   ""They'll be able to have a life,"" says Nicole, sitting on with her husband on a couch in the living room. That thought flashed through Christian's mind too when he recently visited the boys.  ""I was like, 'Oh, man, I'm so glad. It was definitely the right decision,' "" Christian says. ""I was just looking at Jadon. He's probably going to be a normal little boy. Before, without the surgery, it would have been horrible for him and Anias. Then, I looked at Anias, too. And I was thinking about him. He's going to be a lot better off than he would've been if he hadn't had the surgery."" How do they maintain a semblance of sanity amid the stress? ""Those little smiling faces when you walk in,"" says Christian. ""They smile so big at you, and they get so excited to see you. ... It's amazing how happy they are. ""Everything they go through, they're just always smiling and happy. We learn a lot from them."" Excited boys, ecstatic mom Nicole pops into the boys' room at Blythedale. The two are sitting in high chairs in opposite corners. Their faces immediately light up at her presence, and their arms and legs kick excitedly.  She rushes to Anias first and smothers him in kisses. ""Anias, I see you,"" Nicole shouts. She admires his onesie adorned with images of a magnet and a baby chicken. ""Chick magnet,"" it reads. ""I love your shirt today,"" Nicole says. Across the room, Jadon points to the buckles keeping him locked in his chair, as if to say, ""Undo these, please!"" Nicole rushes to see him, unbuckling his strap and lifting him into her arms. She gives him kisses. He responds with kisses of his own. ""Thank you for the kisses,"" she says. ""Now your brother is jealous. We've got to go get him."" They join Anias in his section of the room. A physical therapist soon enters and takes Jadon away for a 30-minute session. As he's leaving, he blows his mom a kiss and tells her, ""Bye."" This has been their life on the good days: moments of sheer joy and love.  In addition to physical therapy, the boys receive speech and occupational therapy.  Jadon has started doing block puzzles and making animal noises. His expressive language is also about that of a 9-month-old. He rolls across the room, lifts his head and sits up by himself. He learns new tasks fast. He can roll a ball while he's sitting, and he can get up on his hands and knees and rock back and forth.  Anias is still learning what things are. His speech is delayed. He makes sounds like ""bah-bah-bah"" during speech therapy and is able to say ""da-da."" The physical therapist in Nicole has prepared her well. She works with Anias on getting him to stand and track objects with his eyes. Because he struggles with his right side, she places toys on that side to make him work harder. He'll track the toy and then roll, lift his head and stretch ever so gingerly with his right hand. ""He's my slow, steady turtle,"" Nicole says. ""Anias is going to do it all. It's just going to take more time."" Lead neurosurgeon Dr. James Goodrich and lead plastic surgeon Dr. Oren Tepper say they are pleased with how the boys are progressing. The situation is understandably stressful for the parents and the boys, but from a medical standpoint, the twins are doing well.  In the weeks after the surgery, Goodrich's biggest concerns were bleeding, fluid buildup and infection of tissue surrounding the brain. ""We've been able to avoid all of that, which is very gratifying,"" he says. ""In rehab, they're actually starting to develop what infants are supposed to do in the sense of being able to sit, stand, hold their heads, and starting to stand with assistance."" Tepper adds, ""I can tell you the trajectory looks very good for both boys right now. (Their infections) have been local with no signs of meningitis, which would be essentially an infection surrounding the brain or something deep. Neither one have had any problems like that."" Both credit Nicole for getting the boys this far -- a combination of her effusive love and her years as a physical therapist. ""Nicole's abilities as a parent and skills as a medical professional are really quite unique,"" says Goodrich. ""She has spent every day, pre- and post-surgeries, strengthening Jadon and Anias, in every respect, from physical therapy to wound care management to interaction and play time. She has dedicated herself to helping them thrive."" Her husband says simply, ""She is Superwoman."" The real work, she says, will begin when she and Christian can bring their boys home. Jadon's wound dressings have to be changed twice a day. Anias eats via a tube every four to six hours. There will be diapers to change, mouths to feed and constant tasks. In between, she'll have to dedicate time to her 3-year-old, Aza.  Still, she's looking forward to the job.  Her plan is to work with Jadon and Anias on simple tasks, getting them to repeat each one 20 to 30 times so they can thrive. ""Every way that I hold them, every way that I sit them, every way that I position them is in thinking with what's going to improve their condition,"" Nicole says. She says she can tell Anias will have some delays and is eager to work consistently with him. ""I can foresee him walking, and I can see him doing all the things he needs to do to function in a community and in his home environment,"" she says.  ""I just want to get them home so I can practice with them all day long."" Late last week, Nicole and Christian learned that may soon happen. A doctor at Blythedale told them the subject of Jadon and Anias going home was brought up at the medical team's weekly meeting. ""I don't want to scare you with this concept,"" the doctor said, ""but what do you think about moving in this direction?"" Nicole's heart swelled. She says she nearly jumped out of her chair. She's thought about that moment almost all day, every day. The picture is clear in her mind: She and Christian are sitting in their living room, each holding one of the boys, while Aza runs up and hugs them. There's no worry about them being sick or sleeping in a sterile hospital room without their mother.  ""It's just bliss,"" she says.  She's thought of practical things too, like getting them cribs and preparing their room.  ""We just want to be a family,"" Christian says.  The date of their return home has not been set, but the preparation has begun.  It's the start of making their family whole. A new life, together.  CNN's Roni Selig contributed to this report. "

They are not even accountable to their own customers because nobody knows how these companies curate content.” The senators have both alleged, with little evidence, that social media companies are censoring conservative viewpoints. The internet search giant, along with the rest of Silicon Valley, has denied making any content decisions based on politics.

229,"Apple just unveiled the Apple Watch Series 5, which comes in new titanium and ceramic casings and has an always-on display.Like the name suggests, the always-on display allows you to view information at a glance without moving your wrist to turn the screen on — a feature that brings a lot more convenience to the Apple Watch.Here's a brief look at the Apple Watch, based on the few minutes I had with it.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.CUPERTINO, California — Apple just unveiled an updated version of the Apple Watch that comes with a new always-on display, a built-in compass, and new titanium and ceramic finishes. The new watch, called the Series 5, starts at $400 and will be launching on September 20.That always-on display is important for the Apple Watch because it makes it much better at its most basic job: functioning as a wristwatch. Now that the Apple Watch has an always-on display, you can just glance down at your wrist to see the time and other information without having to move your wrist to turn on the screen. That brings the Apple Watch up to speed with rivals like Fitbit, which just announced the Versa 2, another smartwatch with an always-on screen. Samsung's Galaxy Watch also has a screen that can stay on to show the time and other bits of information, even if you're not looking directly at it. I spent a few minutes trying out the new Apple Watch Series 5 after Apple's press event. Here's a preview of what it's like to use.







 



When the Apple Watch Series 5's display isn't activated, it will look something like this.










You can still see important information, but the display is dimmer to conserve battery life. 





Then when you raise your wrist, the screen brightens up as usual.










Although Fitbit's Versa 2 also has an always-on display, Apple has a critical advantage: The watch faces are optimized to work in always-on mode, unlike Fitbit's. That makes the transition feel much more seamless because you're essentially looking at the same content on-screen when moving between always-on mode and standard mode. This worked pretty seamlessly during my brief hands-on time with the device, but I did notice that it worked best when I raised my wrist slowly. 



 



Other features are designed to work in always-on mode too.










It's not just the watch faces that are optimized to work when the Apple Watch's display isn't activated. The workout app also takes advantage of the watch's always-on functionality.When you're running a workout, for example, the screen will dim, and the watch will pare back certain details to conserve power. In always-on display mode, for example, the milliseconds next to your workout timer will disappear. But when you raise your wrist, the screen will light up, and the workout app will appear the same as usual.





The Apple Watch's new titanium casing felt surprisingly light.










For the first time, the Apple Watch is available in a titanium casing, which comes in natural and space-black color options. The titanium version feels incredibly lightweight, much more so than the stainless steel and new ceramic version. It feels almost as light as the entry-level aluminum Apple Watch. 



 



And the ceramic edition has a slick, clean feel.










The ceramic Apple Watch has a glossy look that's reminiscent of Apple's classic white plastic MacBook. The company also says the ceramic finish is scratch-resistant. 





It looks like there's a lot of potential for the Apple Watch's compass to be integrated into apps.










During my brief time with the watch, I saw how the built-in compass could be used to make navigation apps more useful. For example, in the Maps app, the compass will make it possible for you to see which direction you're facing, right on your wrist. There's also a stargazing app that uses the compass to display the precise direction of specific constellations. 



 



But overall, it feels like it could be a relatively minor upgrade.










Features like a built-in compass and an always-on display are definitely welcome additions that make using the Apple Watch more convenient. And the fact that the cellular version can now be used to contact emergency services internationally boosts its usefulness when it comes to safety.But upgrades like this suggest that the smartwatch market is maturing in a similar way as the smartphone industry — that's to say that wearables are now so advanced that there are only minor ways to improve them. The major leaps — like standalone cellular connectivity in a sleek form factor — may be behind us.Now we're just waiting for Apple to make two other important improvements: native sleep tracking and battery life that lasts for multiple days.Tell us what you think!"

Attorney General Barbara Underwood (D) said her office opened the investigation because ""New Yorkers deserve to know that their personal information will be protected.""  We’ve opened an investigation into the Marriott data breach. New Yorkers deserve to know that their personal information will be protected. Marriott released a statement earlier Friday that said a ""hack could have exposed"" information on up to approximately 500 million guests who made a reservation at a Starwood property. The New York attorney general's office told The Hill that New York law required Marriott to alert it of the breach immediately once it was discovered. It accused Marriott of not doing so. ""Under New York law, Marriott was required to provide notification to our office upon discovering the breach; they have not done so as of yet,"" it said in a statement to The Hill.  Marriott said it has reported the hack to law enforcement and is supporting their investigation. But it is unclear exactly when the breach was reported to law enforcement, or to what department. A representative from Marriott did not immediately respond to The Hill about the attorney general's claim that the breach was not properly flagged. View the discussion thread.

231,"Relationships between landlords and their tenants don’t need to be fraught ones. With Y Combinator -backed Latchel, landlords and property managers can access a 24/7 maintenance service that takes requests from tenants and deploys the right professional to fix the things that need fixing. “At first we thought of doing a high-tech property management system,” Latchel founder Ethan Lieber told TechCrunch. “As we looked more into it and talked to other property management companies, maintenance kept coming up as a problem. So we decided to focus on maintenance.” Latchel has a bunch of handypeople — all vetted and with at least two years of experience — in its network that it relies on for work inside buildings. In some cases, however, larger property management groups already have people they like to work with. At that point, Latchel simply takes over the relationship and coordinates between the handypeople and residents. In the event Latchel’s on-demand team of vetted handypeople cannot troubleshoot the issue, Latchel deploys one of the 3,000+ contractors on its platform. “It’s such a hard industry to get positive reviews from tenants in,” Lieber said. “You’re basically talking about someone in an emergency situation — not getting heat, the toilet is overflowing, etcetera. If you’re not handling it well, it exacerbates. If you can communicate the right things to the right people at the right time, it absolves that exacerbation.” Still, the real estate space is unique and hard to acquire customers, Lieber said. Right now, while Latchel does support larger property managers, it’s focused on the DIY landlords — the ones who may be managing buildings in their “spare” time or as a second job. In order to support the growth of DIY landlord customers, Latchel is looking to build its contractor network. Part of its sell to contractors is the constant stream of work that results from Latchel’s relationships with property managers and landlords. In March 2018, Latchel was running its service on 2,000 units. Today, Latchel supports 27,500 units across 50 cities in the U.S. and has been adding about 4,000 to 5,000 new units a month. That averages out to about 250 units per customer, Lieber said. Looking into next month, Latchel wants to add an additional 6,000 units. The month after, it wants to add an additional 9,000. The cost of Latchel depends on the service level and the number of units. If a landlord or property manager just wants basic services (tenant calls, coordination of emergency work) for after-hours coverage, Latchel charges a $25 account fee and then 80 cents per unit per month. Currently, Latchel is conducting a beta test with properties that have fewer than 10 units to guarantee a maximum price of services per unit, Lieber said. If Latchel is unable to negotiate a good enough price for the contractor, Latchel will reimburse customers for any costs over the guaranteed max price. Since launching its full-service solution last March, Latchel says its average tenant review is 4.7 out of 5 stars. In all, Latchel says it has reduced the amount of time spent on maintenance to 15 minutes per day for property management companies with 100 units or fewer."

233,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — The Trump administration is planning to roll out its first concrete measures against China on trade, administration officials said on Thursday, hardening its position toward America’s largest trading partner just as President Trump welcomed President Xi Jinping of China to his seaside club here for their first face-to-face meeting. Sometime after Mr. Xi leaves the United States, these officials said, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order targeting countries that dump steel into the American market, an aggressive measure aimed mainly at China. It is unclear exactly what the order would do or how harsh it would be, but it would be designed to begin to make good on Mr. Trump’s promise during the campaign to redress China’s huge trade surplus with the United States. In addition, an official said, the White House is moving out a senior economy policy official, Andrew Quinn, who had helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, former President Barack Obama’s signature trade initiative. Mr. Quinn had become the subject of a battle between two camps in the White House: economic nationalists, who wanted him out, and more mainstream backers of free trade, who defended him. Taken together, these developments constituted a potentially significant victory for the hard-liners, coming off a string of setbacks in their efforts to persuade the president to deliver on the most combative anti-free-trade planks of his presidential campaign. But the ultimate outcome of this policy debate is still far from clear, several officials said. Mr. Trump does not plan to confront Mr. Xi with the most aggressive of his campaign threats: a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods. Nor is the United States likely to designate China a currency manipulator, something he promised to do as a candidate. Holding back those moves suggests Mr. Trump is also heeding the more moderate voices among his advisers, who argue that the United States cannot afford to ignite a trade war with China. “The nativist and nationalist forces certainly have influence,” said Nicholas Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson International Institute for Economics. “But it looks like it’s dwindling rapidly.” Mr. Lardy said anti-dumping cases on steel were mostly symbolic, since American imports of steel from China accounted for only a few percentage points of the trade deficit. The Obama administration filed multiple anti-dumping cases with the World Trade Organization. Still, the pitched battle over trade policy, on the eve of Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Xi, injected an unpredictable note into an encounter that has been billed mostly as a get-acquainted session for the two leaders. Mr. Trump made it clear the informal setting would not prevent him from confronting his guest with the chronic imbalances between the United State and China. “We have been treated unfairly and have made terrible trade deals with China for many, many years,” he said to reporters on Air Force One. “That’s one of the things we are going to be talking about.” Mr. Xi arrived in Florida on Thursday afternoon, stepping off his Air China flight into the humid air of Palm Beach. On Thursday evening, he attended a formal dinner at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. A series of meetings were scheduled for Friday morning, followed by a working lunch. Ethics experts say Donald J. Trump’s visits to properties owned, managed or branded by the Trump Organization amount to free publicity for the company and blur the line between his family business and presidential duties. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson greeted Mr. Xi and his wife, who walked on a red carpet, flanked by an honor guard carrying flags of both countries. Mr. Trump, who arrived from Washington later, greeted Mr. Xi in an arrival ceremony at the front steps of the estate. Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Tillerson said the president was prepared to demand an “economic relationship that is fair on both sides” and said the chief goal of the nation’s trade policy would be fashioned after the president’s “America First” credo. “To that end,” he said, “we will pursue economic engagement with China that prioritizes the economic well-being of the American people.” For weeks leading up to this meeting, China has served as a kind of proxy for Mr. Trump’s advisers to play out their clashing worldviews. The hard-line contingent — led by the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and the director of the National Trade Council, Peter Navarro — squared off against the more traditional group, which included two former Goldman Sachs executives, Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Mnuchin, one official said, has gravitated in recent days toward a tougher line on China. Mr. Bannon, officials said, pushed hard for the removal of Mr. Quinn, a special assistant for international trade, investment and development. Mr. Quinn had the support of his boss, Mr. Cohn, a Democrat who has emerged as an influential voice with Mr. Trump on economic policy. But he was unable to save Mr. Quinn, who will return to his previous post with the Office of the United States Trade Representative. In a conciliatory gesture, the two countries are expected to announce they will continue to hold an annual high-level dialogue on strategic and economic issues, which began during the George W. Bush administration and continued under Mr. Obama, though there has been some talk of elevating the session to the level of Vice President Mike Pence. Among the sensitive topics that may come up is American concern about the possibility that Chinese investors might seek to purchase the nuclear power business of Westinghouse Electric Co. Westinghouse, once a symbol of America’s leadership in nuclear energy, was forced to file for bankruptcy in late March, in the face of mounting losses. Though many of its wounds were self-inflicted — a disastrous deal for a construction business proved too costly — broad market and industry forces have also changed the economic calculus for nuclear energy. American officials are profoundly concerned about the potential national security implications of a purchase of Westinghouse by interests with ties to the Chinese government, including the danger that a sale could deliver sensitive nuclear secrets to that nation. A White House official said Thursday that the administration is watching the potential sale closely but declined to comment on options that the United States government might have to block the sale to Chinese interests. Bloomberg News first reported about the government’s concern about the sale. Discussions about the issue are underway among top American officials at the Department of Energy, the State Department and the Treasury Department. Even before the bankruptcy, Westinghouse’s Japanese parent was already moving away from the business of building nuclear power plants, focusing instead on maintaining existing reactors and developing reactors. It follows a broad pattern in the business, as big companies reassess the viability of nuclear and the field of players shrinks. General Electric has pared its nuclear operations, while the French builder Areva is going through a major restructuring. China has been moving to fill the void, as it increasingly develops its nuclear abilities and pushes homegrown players to look for opportunities beyond their borders. But China’s increasing presence in nuclear energy has raised security concerns in some countries."

235,"(Adds new tourist warning, minister’s comment) MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Russian airports have stepped up screening of travellers arriving from China to try to identify people infected with the new coronavirus, airport officials said on Tuesday. The World Health Organisation has said that the coronavirus outbreak, which the mayor of the Chinese city of Wuhan says has killed six people, was likely to spread. In Russia, at least four airports - Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo in Moscow, as well as airports in Yekaterinburg and Irkutsk - have introduced screening measures to try to identify infected passengers, Russian airport officials said. The virus was a threat to Russia, Deputy Health Minister Sergei Kraevoi was cited as saying by the RIA news agency. Russia’s consumer health regulator, Rospotrebnadzor, advised Russian tourists who planned to go to China to refrain from visiting Wuhan and to steer clear of zoos and of markets selling animals and seafood. The regulator said it could not rule out the possibility of the infection spreading to Russia, but evaluated the risk of a widespread outbreak in Russia as low, the Interfax news agency reported. It was also cited as saying that a testing system to diagnose the new coronavirus had been developed in Russia and that laboratories would start receiving it by the end of the week. Regional authorities have already been briefed on measures they need to take to reduce the risks of an epidemic. More than 1.5 million Chinese citizens visit Russia each year, according to Rospotrebnadzor.

237,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s central bank on Friday issued sweeping guidelines to tighten rules on asset management business, the latest step by Beijing to fend off systemic risks in the country’s rampantly growing shadow banking sector. The guidelines unified rules covering asset management products issued by banks, trust firms, insurance asset management companies, securities firms, funds and futures companies, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a joint statement with the banking, insurance, securities and foreign exchange regulators. At the end of 2016, the collective outstanding volume of their asset management business was 102 trillion yuan ($15.38 trillion), including 29 trillion yuan of bank wealth management products and 17.5 trillion yuan in trust products, according to the PBOC. The new rules aim to close loopholes that allow regulatory arbitrage, reduce leverage levels to curb asset price bubbles and rein in shadow banking activity. The new rules will set leverage limits for asset management products. They will cap the total assets to net assets ratio at 140 percent for open mutual funds and 200 percent for private funds. Investors will be prohibited from pledging their shares in asset management products as collateral to obtain financing, a practice that would increase leverage. The central bank also said financial institutions must break the practice of providing investors with implicit guarantees against investment losses. Financial institutions will also be forbidden from creating a “capital pool” to manage funds raised through asset management products. The practice allows banks to roll over the products constantly. The investment losses will be implicitly covered by the new product issuance. The draft guidelines are the latest and most comprehensive set of rules proposed by financial regulators to fend off shadow banking risks that could spread across different asset classes. “Clearly this is a critical turning point of the financial regulations”, said Zhou Hao, a Singapore-based analyst at Commerzbank. “Over the past few years, while the financial risks were rising, the overall regulations were actually behind the curve.” PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has warned that China’s financial system is becoming increasingly vulnerable due to high leverage and accumulating “hidden, complex, sudden, contagious and hazardous” latent risks. Financial institutions will not be allowed to use asset management products to invest in commercial banks’ credit assets or provide “channel service” for other institutions to bypass regulations, according to the statement. Also, financial institutions will be required to provision 10 percent of their management fee income from asset management products as risk reserves. “The coordinated and unified regulatory requirements on financial institutions’ asset management products will reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage and the economic incentives behind shadow banking practices,” said David Yin, a senior analyst at Moody’s. Earlier this year, China set up a top-level committee under the State Council to safeguard financial stability, with the central bank playing a leading role. Non-financial institutions will be prohibited from issuing or selling asset management products. And highly-indebted companies will not be allowed to invest in such products. The transition period for the new regulations lasts until June 30, 2019, the statement said. “The new requirements will push asset management business to go back to its essence and prevent risks to transfer cross-sector and cross-markets,” said Dong Ximiao, a senior researcher at Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China.

238,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell almost rocked the boat during the FOMC's October press conference on Wednesday after announcing a third straight cut to U.S. interest rates. What happened: Powell initially said it would take a ""material reassessment"" in the outlook for the Fed to change its view that no further rate cuts were needed — but minutes later he reversed course, saying that holding rates at their current levels would be appropriate as long as the outlook stayed within the Fed’s expectations. Quick take: That meant the Fed's rate-cutting cycle went from pause to ""pause lite,"" DRW Trading rates strategist Lou Brien tells Axios.  Powell's adjustment to ""pause lite"" reversed the decline in U.S. equities and the gains in U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar, sending both lower on the day. The big picture: ""Pause lite"" is also an apt description for the status of the global economy's two major risks — the U.S-China trade war and Brexit.  The tariffs on imported U.S. and Chinese goods that have been wreaking havoc on the manufacturing sector, business sentiment and investment remain in place, but no new tariffs have been added thanks to the ""phase one"" trade deal.  Similarly, Brexit has been pushed back to Jan. 31, leaving in place the uncertainty that has curtailed business activity in Britain and caused economic growth to fall into negative territory in Q2. But the U.K. is still in the EU. Why it matters: ""It can be said that Powell thinks there will not be any reason to ease again in the short or medium term, but that he can be convinced to ease if things don’t go right,"" Brien adds. Powell's view seems to reflect that of the market, as stocks have jumped to new all-time highs this week and Treasury yields have risen to their highest level in more than a month, with the yield curve steepening.  And with Powell's assurances that the Fed will be there to cut rates further should things get worse, the market is feeling confident. Between the lines: Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s CIO of global fixed income, asserts that the Fed's policy rate is now just right and is ""delivering a very powerful dose of the 'right stuff' from a policy perspective."" The Fed has moved to near ""the equilibrium rate of interest in an economy that’s facing aging demographic trends, and which benefits from still positive interest rates,"" Rieder says in a note.  ""Vitally important is the fact that Fed policy will stop short of persistently cutting rates into the unproductive arena of negative rates.""

239,"Emmanuel Macron, who leads the runoff for French president, met with union leaders today in a Whirlpool factory that is scheduled to close and move to Poland, all in an attempt to strike at his rival's political heartland in northern France. But his plans went awry and turned into a chaotic, hour-long back-and-forth with jeering workers when far-right leader Marine Le Pen got there first and promised to keep the plant open — giving hope to the 300 employees whose jobs are under threat. Strategically speaking: Le Pen is a far more skilled campaigner than the more robotic Macron and she's showing why she remains a formidable threat to Macron in the May 7 election. While virtually all of France's establishment has now endorsed Macron, that is a similar scenario to what preceded Brexit and Donald Trump's respective triumphs. The next political polls will be important. Why it's important: After Brexit and Trump, the French election is the third major opportunity for western voters to decide whether to maintain the post-war political and economic framework, or to bust it up. Macron favors the former, and Le Pen the latter."
240,"LONDON/NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. boutique investment bank Centerview has found an office in the heart of Paris and is hiring senior bankers to establish a second European hub as Brexit looms, three sources told Reuters. Centerview, which already has an office in London’s Mayfair, has rented space on the upmarket Avenue Matignon and plans to open for business in the next few months, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. The New York-based bank has held talks with a number of prominent dealmakers in Paris including the former boss of Lazard in France, Matthieu Pigasse, the sources said. Its target list also includes Deutsche Bank’s (DBKGn.DE) co-head of corporate and investment banking Emmanuel Hasbanian and Barclays (BARC.L) managing director Yann Krychowski, who specializes in financial services, the sources said. The two were recently approached by Centerview but an agreement over a possible move has yet to be found, they said. Centerview, Hasbanian and Krychowski declined to comment. Pigasse did not respond to a request for comment. The bank’s push into continental Europe comes with Britain set to leave the European Union on Jan. 31. Large investment banks and independent advisory outfits are bulking up their presence across Europe to ensure access to continental clients. The value of French mergers and acquisitions (M&A) rose 2% last year to $193 billion, the third highest in the past decade, according to Refinitiv data. That was mainly due to a surge in outbound M&A which spiked 33% to a record $115 billion, despite a general slowdown in European activity, the data showed. Citi (C.N) topped the French M&A league table in 2019 followed by Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) with only three independent advisory firms - Lazard, Perella Weinberg & Partners and D’Angelin & Co - making the top 10. Centerview ranked fourth last year for global M&A deals led by advisory boutiques with a 2.1% share of the overall fee pool. Lazard took the largest slice. Centerview is betting on a mix of junior and seasoned deal-makers to drive its French roll-out as it wants to become the advisor of choice for big French companies, the sources said. It recently landed a key advisory role representing U.S. jeweler Tiffany (TIF.N) in takeover negotiations with French luxury group LVMH (LVMH.PA) - a milestone transaction for French dealmaking in the United States. Pigasse, whose contract with Lazard ended on Dec. 31, would help Centerview woo large French clients. He has held talks about a senior role at Centerview in Paris but has yet to commit, the sources said. The U.S. bank, co-founded by Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan, is also close to poaching two other former Lazard dealmakers, Nicolas Constant and Pierre Pasqual, the sources said. Constant helped Pigasse advise French cosmetics giant L’Oreal (OREP.PA) while at Lazard, two of the sources said. Neither Constant nor Pasqual were immediately available for comment. Other M&A newcomers in France include Perella Weinberg - the investment bank founded by Joe Perella and Peter Weinberg - and Greenhill & Co (GHL.N). Perella launched its Paris office in 2018, luring French bankers from Bank of America (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs while Greenhill picked Amelie Negrier-Oyarzabal, a former Lazard partner, to open its French hub in late 2019. New York-based Evercore Inc (EVR.N) tapped headhunting firm Charta Partners last year to attract French bankers with long-standing relationships with the country’s key companies but has yet to open a local office.

241,"ZURICH (Reuters) - An interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve could help the Swiss National Bank in its efforts to keep a lid on the value of the strong Swiss franc, SNB governing board member Andrea Maechler said on Monday. “A U.S. rate hike could trigger capital flows from Switzerland to the U.S.,” Maechler said in a interview with Swiss broadcaster SRF. “That would of course be good for the Swiss franc.” Maechler said negative interest rates remained “absolutely necessary” in Switzerland as a way to prevent the appreciation of the currency which the SNB has long described as “significantly overvalued”. “Without negative interest rates the franc would be much stronger and therefore have a negative effect on the economy and the employment market,” Maechler said. She said did not rule out a further interest rate cut from the level of -0.75 percent which the SNB has charged since January 2015, although this would be introduced only if “really necessary”, Maechler told SRF. “We will do that only if the advantages outweigh” the negatives, she said.

242,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis issued a stinging criticism of atrocities against Myanmar’s Rohingya minority on Wednesday, saying they had been tortured and killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and Muslim faith. The pope’s remarks at his weekly audience followed last week’s U.N. report that said security forces in the north of the country had carried out mass killings, gang rapes and had burned villages. “They have been suffering for years, they have been tortured, killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and their Muslim faith,” the pope said. “They have been thrown out of Myanmar, moved from one place to the other because no one wants them. But they are good people, peaceful people. They are not Christian. They are good people. They are our brothers and sisters,” he said. After the report was issued on Friday, the United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, said Myanmar’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi had promised to investigate the allegations. Myanmar, a mostly Buddhist country, had previously denied almost all allegations of human rights abuses against Muslims in the north. The pope is expected to visit neighbouring Bangladesh later this year. Witnesses cited in the U.N. report testified to “the killing of babies, toddlers, children, women and elderly; opening fire at people fleeing; burning of entire villages; massive detention; massive and systematic rape and sexual violence; deliberate destruction of food and sources of food”.

243,"* Like-for-like sales grow 11.3 pct y/y in Q3 * Analysts had expected more muted revenue growth * Asian demand stable, pick up in Europe, Americas * Currency setbacks linger amid strengthening euro * Shares rise (Updates with quote, forecasts) By Sarah White PARIS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Luxury handbag maker Hermes said sales growth had accelerated in the third quarter, as demand for its perfume and scarf lines proved particularly strong and its performance in Europe and the Americas improved. The French label, famed for its $10,000-plus Kelly and Birkin bags and squared silk scarves, said revenues stood at 1.34 billion euros ($1.55 billion) in the July to September period, up 11.3 percent year-on-year on a comparable basis. Luxury goods companies including France’s LVMH and Kering are benefiting from revived appetite from Chinese consumers, boosting their sales this year even as they grapple with a strengthening euro. That can temper demand from visitors on shopping trips to Europe and also hurt earnings converted into the currency. Hermes - which makes most of its products, including its handmade bags, in France - said revenues had taken a 25 million-euro hit from currency effects in the first nine months of the year. Sales in that period stood at 4.05 billion euros. The company reiterated that its first-half operating performance, which saw margins rise to a record high, could not be extrapolated to the full year as the impact of beneficial currency hedges wears off. But it was upbeat on other fronts, confirming that comparable sales in its leather goods unit, the biggest contributor to earnings, would grow 10 percent in 2017. Revenues in the division grew at a slightly slower pace in the third quarter compared to the previous three months. They picked up sharply, however, in the smaller fragrances unit after the launch of Hermes’ new Twilly perfume for women, and clothing sales were robust. Sales growth in Asia, which is Hermes’ biggest region by revenues, was stable from one quarter to the next. “Mainland china enjoyed an acceleration in the sales growth and a very positive momentum, as you can see across the industry,” Chief Executive Axel Dumas told journalists, adding that south Asian countries such as Malaysia had also done well. Analysts had expected sales across the group to rise by a more muted 8.5 percent on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency fluctuations. They had grown 8.3 percent in the second quarter. Hermes shares climbed 1.3 percent in early session trading, with the stock up roughly 15 percent so far in 2017. “All in all, another solid quarter from Hermes,” Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst att RBC, said in a note. Hermes is hiring staff for new leather workshops to meet demand, and like many rivals it is also trying to improve its online presence. It has relaunched its website in Canada and the United States, while the European version is due next year. $1 = 0.8629 euros

""They plan to study a wide range of fields across the social sciences, biological and medical sciences, physical sciences and mathematics, and the humanities,"" adds Gerson. In August, when Askew stepped into her role as First Captain of the U.S. Military Academy's Corps of Cadets, her leadership position broke both racial and gender barriers. According to the Associated Press, women make up just 20 percent of cadets, who are mostly commissioned as second lieutenants in the Army after graduation. In 2014, the Academy created a diversity office to help widen its student demographics and recruit more women and African-Americans for department heads and leaders. Pam Locke, who serves as Askew's mentor, was one of two African-American women to graduate from West Point's first class of women in 1980. She tells the AP that to date, the academy averages less than 20 African-American women graduating each year out of a class of 1,000 students. ""And yet, out of that 20 we got a first captain,"" she says of Askew's new appointment. ""Isn't that amazing?"" For many, Askew's history-making position came as no surprise. According to The New York Times, the young leader served as her school's student body president in high school, was the captain of her volleyball team, started her school's Black Student Union and spent her high school summers volunteering at an orphanage in the Dominican Republic. ""That leadership is something I've seen throughout her life — wanting to be first, wanting to be the best, wanting to win, in sports, in academics, in every aspect of her life,"" her mother tells the AP. ""And to serve others, as well."" Askew earned nominations for her West Point and Naval Academy applications from prominent figures such as Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and the superintendent of West Point. Her former volleyball coach, Christine Zanellato, tells The New York Times that all of the young leader's accomplishments are a testament to planning and hard work. ""To achieve what she's achieved, it takes thoughtful, long-term planning,"" Zanellato says. ""It's not something that just happens. It's something she worked for."""

246,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish power grid operator PSE said on Tuesday it will cooperate with Israel Electric Corporation Limited to fight potential cyber threats in the energy sector. PSE said the Israeli utility was a leader in its region in the cybersecurity field. PSE started a computer emergency response team (CERT) at the end of 2016 to help maintain cybersecurity. The special unit has already started cooperation with its counterparts in the United States and Norway. “We gain an experienced partner, effective in fighting cybercrime. This is extremely important at a time when cybercriminals and cyber-terrorists develop cooperation among themselves and create more and more advanced tools of attacks,” PSE Chief Executive Eryk Klossowski was quoted as saying in a statement. PSE had said in the past that its IT systems are being regularly targeted by cybercriminals, but the attempts are successfully repelled.

247,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police on Friday withdrew from a university campus trashed by weeks of clashes as pro-democracy activists canvassed social media to promote more protests at the weekend. Senior members of Hong Kong Polytechnic University toured buildings strewn with debris after police left, including a sports hall and a ruined Starbucks outlet, seeing smashed windows and charred piles of former barricades. After more than five months of increasingly violent demonstrations, the Chinese-ruled city has enjoyed relative calm since local elections on Sunday delivered an overwhelming victory to pro-democracy candidates. Activists are trying to keep up momentum, after winning backing from U.S. President Donald Trump that has renewed global attention on the Asian financial hub and infuriated Beijing. “Many classrooms, laboratories and library were destroyed. Even so, there’s been no loss of life. We insisted on adopting a humane way to solve the crisis,” university president Teng Jin-Guang told reporters, saying the next semester would go ahead on time. Located on Kowloon peninsula, the campus became a battleground earlier this month when protesters barricaded themselves in and fought riot police in a hail of petrol bombs, water cannon and tear gas. Police arrested more than 1,300 people during the turmoil at the university, Kwok Ka-chuen, a senior police official, told reporters on Friday. A total of 5,890 people have been arrested since early June, he added. Before police left, they seized nearly 4,000 Molotov cocktails and hundreds of bottles of chemicals, Kwok said. At one point on Friday, a man and woman emerged from the campus wearing black face masks and walked out hand-in-hand, with no sign of police. Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering, says it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time, and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest. Beijing warned Washington of “firm counter measures” after Trump signed legislation supporting the protesters on Wednesday. On a visit to Bangkok, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Friday tried to reassure the Thai government and businesses that her city was still an attractive financial hub. The anti-government protests have at times forced businesses, government, schools and even the international airport to close. The unrest has hit the economy, with data on Friday showing tourist arrivals fell 44% in October from a year earlier. A few hundred protesters, some carrying Union Jack flags, gathered at the British consulate on Friday urging London to extend citizenship to Hong Kong residents born before the 1997 handover to China and classified as overseas British nationals. They chanted “We are all Simon”, referring to a former consulate employee, Simon Cheng, who said Chinese secret police beat him and deprived him of sleep seeking information about activists behind the protests. Hong Kong’s justice secretary has urged him to report the matter to the relevant Chinese authorities and said she has no opinion on the accusations. Other demonstrations planned over the weekend include a rally by secondary school students, a protest against the use of tear gas near children, and a “march of gratitude” to the U.S. consulate. A rally planned for Dec. 8 by Civil Human Rights Front, the group that organized million-strong marches in June, is likely to provide the best gauge of the democracy movement’s support.

250,"An issue that Restoration Hardware's management had written off as a short-term hiccup may end up having a longer-than-expected drag on its top-line. While pre-announcing the retailer's fiscal fourth-quarter results in February, CEO Gary Friedman blamed out-of-stock merchandise at its budding RH Modern chain as one of the key culprits behind its shortfall. In a letter to shareholders that day, Friedman assured investors that the majority of Restoration Hardware's written orders would translate into revenue during the first and second quarters, and that its vendors would be ""substantially caught up"" by the end of the first half. Now, three weeks after Friedman's comments, BB&T analyst Anthony Chukumba is calling into question just how severe an impact the retailer's chronic out-of-stock conditions could have on its first-quarter results — and its long-term brand equity. By conducting a survey on 50 RH Modern products that spanned large furniture and decorative pieces, Chukumba found that just 42 percent of the items selected were in stock, with an estimated average delivery time of nine days. However, 58 percent of the items were out of stock, with the company promising to schedule a delivery in 63 days, on average. For one of the products, the Rivet four-drawer dresser, Restoration Hardware did not promise to contact buyers to schedule delivery until December. ""To be blunt, we find it shocking over half of RH Modern products are currently not in stock and will take over two months on average before customers are even contacted about scheduling deliveries,"" Chukumba told investors. ""We are also troubled by the fact management did not anticipate the high level of RH Modern demand and ensure its supply chain was adequately prepared given its repeated bullish comments on the concept's potential. Our RH Modern survey not only lessens our confidence in [Restoration Hardware's first-quarter] performance, but we believe these issues will leave a lingering bad taste in the mouths of the company's well-heeled (and demanding) customer base, which could have a far longer lasting impact."" On Thursday, Chukumba lowered his rating on the high-end furnishings company to ""hold"" from ""buy."" Restoration Hardware shares were down more than 5 percent midmorning, to under $37. Since January, the company's stock has fallen more than 50 percent. Aside from slow delivery times, Restoration Hardware said softness in markets affected by energy, oil or currency fluctuations, along with affluent consumers' reluctance to spend, contributed to its weaker-than-expected results. In that vein, Williams-Sonoma on Wednesday reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that fell short of analysts' expectations. Comparable sales at its high-end Pottery Barn and PBteen brands declined 2 percent and 12 percent, respectively, offsetting 13 percent growth at the more moderately priced West Elm concept. Despite economic softness, Restoration Hardware's Friedman reiterated to investors last month that its key growth strategies — expanding its product selection and identifying opportunities to generate value from its real estate — ""are working exceptionally well."" In its pre-announcement, the retailer said that it earned an adjusted 99 cents a share in the fourth quarter, compared with Wall Street estimates of $1.39. The company will report complete results for the quarter and full year on March 29."
251,"Accepting an award at Georgetown University, Ms. Yovanovitch, who was a key player in President Trump’s impeachment proceedings, spoke publicly for the first time since her testimony. WASHINGTON — Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who became a central witness in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, delivered a candid and at times stark assessment Wednesday of the declining health of American diplomacy. In her first public remarks since her testimony in November in the impeachment proceedings, Ms. Yovanovitch appeared before a full auditorium at Georgetown University to receive the Trainor Award. The prize, which recognized her long career as a diplomat, also acknowledged the difficult and unexpected role she played during the House investigation into the administration’s shadow diplomacy and the pressure campaign on Ukraine. “Right now, the State Department is in trouble,” Ms. Yovanovitch said in accepting the award. “Senior leaders lack policy vision, moral clarity and leadership.” Warning the students that she would “be blunt,” Ms. Yovanovitch said that “an amoral, ‘keep them guessing’ foreign policy that substitutes threats, fear and confusion for trust cannot work.” Her testimony, along with that of other senior diplomats and members of the National Security Council staff, described how the administration pressured the government of Ukraine to investigate the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a political rival of Mr. Trump, in exchange for the release of military assistance. Several of the people introducing Ms. Yovanovitch, including Thomas R. Pickering, another retired ambassador, commended her perseverance as allies of Mr. Trump sought to brush her aside and even denigrate her professional skills. In December, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, described how he had personally advocated Ms. Yovanovitch’s removal based on his belief that she was standing in the way of his campaign to investigate the role of the younger Biden at a Ukrainian gas company. Last month, Ukraine opened a criminal investigation into whether the president’s associates had placed Ms. Yovanovitch under surveillance to monitor her and perhaps hasten her removal. Ms. Yovanovitch also drew praise for her poise when she ultimately came under direct attack from Mr. Trump himself. In the days surrounding her testimony in the impeachment inquiry, the president unleashed a barrage of criticism against her on Twitter that raised questions about whether the comments amounted to witness tampering. In her speech on Wednesday, Ms. Yovanovitch spoke less about her very public role during the impeachment proceedings and more about the declining impact of the State Department, where she worked from 1986 until she was abruptly recalled last year from Ukraine. Without explicitly naming the president or other officials in the Trump administration, Ms. Yovanovitch lamented a general “hollowing out” of the department in which she spent her career. She lamented damaging budget cuts to other agencies and international organizations working toward American foreign policy goals. “It’s not about a handout for foreign friends; it’s about enlightened self-interest,” she said. “For example, it’s hard to see how cutting funds to the World Health Organization in the middle of the coronavirus crisis keeps Americans safer.” In a more direct evaluation, Ms. Yovanovitch also criticized the current working climate inside the State Department, where she said many long-serving officials had resigned or been forced out, high-level vacancies had gone unfilled and incoming officials were often underprepared. Ms. Yovanovitch spoke of one positive outcome of the impeachment inquiry: greater attention to the political situation in Ukraine, where an American ally is under diplomatic, economic and military assault from Russia. “With all the focus on Ukraine, it has meant that there is continued bipartisan support for a strong Ukraine policy,” she said. “And so I’m grateful for that because I think that’s important for Ukraine, but also for us.” Despite her prognosis, Ms. Yovanovitch, who served under six presidents of both political parties, told students that strengthening diplomacy takes place over longer time horizons than a single administration. She urged them to make the right decision when confronted with a choice between direct orders and constitutional duty. “At a certain point, it is harder to do the wrong thing than the right thing,” she said."
252," (This version of the May 15th story corrects paragraph 18 to say “change” (not “rescind”). This error also occurred in earlier stories in the series)  By Susan Heavey and Leika Kihara  WASHINGTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States is seeking a trade deal with China, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday as talks between the world’s two economic powerhouses resume in Washington this week.  Kudlow, speaking in a live interview with Politico news outlet, said he backed U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s efforts to reach an agreement with Beijing and that both countries must take action.  “He is looking for a deal, I support him on that, wholeheartedly, assuming it’s a good deal. He has my support,” Kudlow said, adding that no agreement had been reached yet.    “Both sides should try to lower tariffs as much as possible ... and to take down non-tariff barriers wherever they are,” he told Politico. “Free and open trade, I think that’s the solution. I think that’s where we are as a group.”  His comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump’s top trade and economic officials prepare to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to discuss concerns ranging from intellectual property protections to farm goods to steel capacity.  Trump has long-promised to crack down on China and raised concerns about an all-out trade war after threatening to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion worth of imports from China,  prompting Beijing to retaliate.   But he offered an olive branch in calling on U.S. officials to revisit penalties for Chinese company ZTE Corp for flouting U.S. sanctions on trade with Iran and North Korea.  “Trade negotiations are continuing with China. They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S., for many years. Stay tuned!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday.      Kudlow told Politico that the United States was not looking for a trade war with China and that it was not clear what action the United States would take toward ZTE.   This week’s meetings follow U.S.-China trade talks in Beijing earlier this month where the two countries failed to reach an agreement on the long list of U.S. demands.      China’s official Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday that Liu and a delegation including People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang, the deputy head of the state planning agency Ning Jizhe and other officials arrived in Washington on Tuesday.    U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, who was at the Beijing talks, said earlier on Tuesday the United States wants a timetable on how China will open up its markets to U.S. exports as the two countries are still not close to resolving trade frictions.   Washington and Beijing have proposed tens of billions of dollars in tit-for-tat tariffs, fanning worries of a full-blown trade war that could disrupt supply chains and dent business investment plans, weighing on the global economy.   Branstad, speaking at a conference in Tokyo, said the Chinese appeared “taken back” by the significance of the list.  “The Chinese have said ‘we want to see the specifics.’ We gave them all the specifics in terms of trade issues. So they can’t say they don’t know what we’re asking for,” he said.  Branstad said China has not met pledges to open up its insurance and financial services area, as well as reduce auto tariffs, and that Trump would like to see a “dramatic increase” in food exports to China.  “We’re still very far apart,” he said.  Branstad said the United States could change the “Section 301” tariffs if China opened its agriculture and auto markets.  Increasing U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas could also be an area where the two countries could agree, he said.  “The United States and China are the two biggest economies in the world. The more we can work things out, the better it’s going to be not just for U.S. and China, but for the entire world economy,” he said.

Amazon Prime Video, which is the first service to be separated from the Prime service, will cost $8.99 per month, according to the company’s website. At the same time, Amazon will offer its Prime subscription on a monthly basis for $10.99 per month. Current members of the Prime subscription service, which includes access to music and faster delivery options, pay $99 per year. Netflix Inc, which offers a similar video subscription service, could be hurt by the move, analysts said. “Amazon certainly has the brand name, the customer relationships, and the focus on high-quality consumer experiences to impact the growth in Netflix’s U.S. subscriber base,” RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note.

254,"A top augmented reality startup is suing its former head of optics for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets in the creation of his own AR company. Meta, which builds augmented reality hardware and software, filed suit earlier this week in a Northern California court against former employee Zhangyi Zhong, his company DreamWorld and 20 unnamed defendants. The lawsuit alleges that Zhong “shamelessly leveraged” his time at the company to “misappropriate confidential and trade secret information relating to Meta’s technologies, supply chain, manufacturing methods and relationships, as well as business, investment and market strategies,” in the creation of his augmented reality startup, DreamWorld. Zhong joined Meta in March of 2015 as a Senior Optical Engineer before his resignation in July of 2016. Meta has raised more than $73 million in funding for its AR systems from top investors, including Y Combinator, Tencent, Comcast Ventures and Lenovo. The San Mateo-based company has built a tethered augmented reality device, the “Meta 2,” which boasts a much wider field-of-view (FoV) than competitors, though its optics rely on far-less complex (and less expensive) technologies than the displays used by products like Microsoft’s HoloLens. While Meta 2 has an FoV measured at around 90-degrees, Zhong claims that his company’s DreamGlass device will have an FoV of 100-degrees. Dreamworld plans to launch pre-orders for the device soon at a price of $350. The Meta 2 development kit currently costs $949. Meta is claiming that Zhong’s has gone beyond stealing trade secrets and is also using Meta’s “market penetration strategy.” While competitors like Microsoft are using the early generations of their hardware to prove out its SLAM mapping technologies while implementing expensive technologies that it hopes to miniaturize and improve, Meta seems to have focused a great deal of its effort on utilizing accessible hardware technologies to bring more robust visual user experiences to developers initially and secure interest while continuing to build out and miniaturize its technologies. In the suit, Meta detailed that it has been creating versions of its optical engine that have wider field-of-views in smaller form factors than its current offering while it has also been exploring the idea of powering future headsets off of mobile devices rather than PCs. Thought the lawsuit details that “Meta believes in free and fair competition in the augmented reality marketplace,” the suit alleges that Zhong had no experience with some of the technologies central to the DreamGlass device before joining Meta. Zhong is listed as an inventor on a patent related to Meta’s “Wide field of view head-mounted display apparatuses, methods and systems.” Oddly, the suit also alleges that Zhong attempted to obscure his identity by changing his nickname from “Johnny” to “Kevin” after leaving the company, while not updating his LinkedIn profile to reflect his new position as CEO of DreamWorld. Meta did not provide further comment on the lawsuit. We have reached out for comment from Zhangyi Zhong and DreamWorld."

257,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s weakening currency is a key concern for more than half of the country’s wealthy elite, with 60 percent of them planning to buy property overseas in the next three years as a hedge against yuan depreciation, according to a rich list report. The most popular destination for that investment was expected to be the United States, in particular the West Coast, followed by Britain, Canada, Australia and Singapore, a study from the Hurun Report released on Monday said. China's yuan CNY=CFXS has fallen around 3.5 percent against the dollar so far this year, dropping more than 1.5 percent in October alone as the greenback rose broadly against other major currencies .DXY. “There’s been a real focus on America, driven by the devaluation of the yuan against the dollar,” Hurun founder Rupert Hoogewerf told Reuters. “Last year people were speculating about a falling yuan but this year its been right there in front of their eyes.” The report, which surveyed around 300 wealthy Chinese between August and October, included questions on yuan depreciation for the first time after it had stood out as a key concern in focus groups ahead of the survey, he said. According to the report, 56 percent of those surveyed said currency depreciation was a concern. Hoogewerf added China’s wealthy targeted having one third of their wealth overseas, either via property or foreign exchange deposits. He said the total wealth of China’s “high net worth individuals” was over 60 trillion yuan ($8.86 trillion), of which only a small portion was currently held outside China. In China, there were 1.34 million so-called high net worth individuals, defined as people with at least 10 million yuan, or about $1.5 million, the report said. Beijing has been trying to stem the flow of capital abroad with a string of measures aimed at closing loopholes and clamping down on illegal transfers. Hoogewerf added rising property prices in Chinese cities was also pushing people to look abroad. “Prices have been booming in China, which has been driving some people overseas,” he said. Overseas financial investment accounted for 15 percent of the wealth of the individuals surveyed by the report. People invested abroad to spread investment risk, give their children a better education and to facilitate emigration, it said.

259,"Scott Dust is an assistant professor of management at the Farmer School of Business at Miami University in Ohio who specializes in leadership and gender equality.In this opinion piece, he writes that tonight's Democratic debate will be an opportunity to push past subconscious sexism and to evaluate candidates on things like policy and leadership.To do this, don't assume you don't have subconscious bias. Articulate your opinions about candidates out loud, and stay open-minded when female candidates go on the offensive.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.""She was very abrasive,"" I said about Carly Fiorina to a room full of female family members after one of the 2016 Republican debates.It did not go over well.Immediately, comparisons were made to the debate behavior of Donald Trump, which was even more fitting of the disapproving adjective. And yet, my initial reaction was to perceive the aggressive woman as abrasive, and let Trump's behavior go without comment.Unfortunately, reactions like mine to women in leadership positions are far from uncommon — even among women themselves. There is real danger in this kind of unconscious bias, particularly when it comes to presidential politics. The reality is that we will never fully realize an equitable democratic process if we are not able to break free of the societal influences that have gotten us to this point. The upcoming Democratic debate offers us a unique opportunity to push back against our subconscious and evaluate the candidates based on critical factors like policy positions and leadership qualities, rather than gender.         The debates are a critical momentIn tonight's Democratic presidential debate, three out of the 10 candidates are women: Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Since each of them entered public life, they have been targets of sexist remarks and judged by different standards than male politicians. The reasons for this are complex, but much of it has to do with how we are conditioned to think about leadership. Through socialization we learn that leaders are supposed to be strong, confident and assertive. Interestingly, we also develop gender stereotypes that are at odds with our notion of what constitutes leadership. Men have substantial overlap with these leadership descriptors, but women are supposed to be something else—compassionate and gentle. This leaves women in an impossible situation. For example, Hillary Clinton, Condoleeza Rice, and Nancy Pelosi are more likely to be perceived as less warm than prototypical females, and also receive backlash when act they like prototypical males.







Debates are critical in that they help viewers evaluate whether the candidates are, well, presidential. Unfortunately for the female candidates, when their male colleagues are aggressive they are viewed as competent and strong, but when women do the same, they are viewed as mean or angry.For example, following a Democratic primary in 2016, Sean Hannity said Hillary Clinton ""looked angry"" and ""sounded angry."" Similarly, during a 2016 debate, Donald Trump infamously accused Hillary Clinton of not having the ""presidential look"" and that she ""doesn't have the stamina""to be president. Leading up to the election, Clinton was the subject of an unusual amount of discourse and was labeled everything from a ""nagging wife"" to ""bitchy.""Thankfully, there has been progress over the last 20 years in conscious gender bias. In a 1995 Gallup poll, 46 percent of respondents said they preferred a male leader, 19 percent a female leader, and 33 percent had no preference. In a subsequent 2017 poll, 15 percent said they preferred a male leader, nine percent a female leader, and 72 percent had no preference. This positive trend can be attributed in part to intentional actions by corporations and other institutions to correct for gender and leadership inequities, like introducing equity and diversity training and instituting new policies. But the real challenge lies in changing what is going on inside our heads. By definition, we do not know when our subconscious mind is puppeteering our actions. Read more: Presidential debates have always been political theater. Here are some of their most memorable moments.How to break free from biases you may haveThere are several things we can do while watching the debates to break free from these cognitive biases.First, don't assume, like I did, that because you don't engage in conscious bias that you won't accidentally engage in subconscious bias. We are all susceptible, no matter our gender or political persuasion. Priming yourself with a self-critical mindset should reel in your subconscious tendencies.Second, when you begin to develop an opinion about a candidate, challenge yourself to articulate out-loud or in writing why you feel that way. In doing so, you are bringing your subconscious thoughts to a conscious platform, which should help you focus on more objective characteristics.Third, keep an open mind when female candidates go on the offense, especially in the early debates, where many do so in order to stand out (e.g., Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden's busing record during the last debate). Don't allow yourself to be turned off by female aggression; the men are doing it too, and it is just part of the political process.Read more: Presidential resumes: We asked voters the qualities they want most in a president, and these are the 2020 Democratic candidates who look best on paperFinally, don't automatically subscribe to the leader prototype. Spend some time breaking down what leadership characteristics, such as integrity, determination, sociability, are genuinely important to you. For example, female leaders, compared to their male counterparts, are considered more adaptive in that they can be assertive yet still work well with others. Perhaps this is precisely the type of leadership than can navigate a divided congress.Great progress has been made to counter gender bias over the last two decades, but most of our progress is specific to conscious bias. The responsibility to continue this progress lies with each of us to push back against the unconscious bias within our own minds. Although it may be challenging to do in the moment, we must be attuned to and flag these thoughts as they happen. As you watch the upcoming debates, be sure to carefully critique your inner-dialogue. The equity of our democratic process depends on it.

260,"* LME/ShFE arb: bit.ly/2wZSAEz (Updates with closing prices) By Peter Hobson LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Zinc and nickel rose on Monday after steep falls late last week and copper prices stabilised, but gains were limited by caution over the demand outlook from top metals consumer China and a stronger U.S. dollar. “We are trying to establish floors now that we are down from recent highs,” said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale. “We are back at what people would perceive as closer to fair value so we should be bottoming out,” he said. ZINC: Three-month zinc on the London Metal Exchange closed up 2.1 percent at $3,096 a tonne, having dropped to a one-week low of $3,000 on Friday. SPREAD: Tight supplies of immediately available metal raised the premium of cash zinc to the three-month contract MZN0-3 to its highest since 2007 at $66, which traders said was likely to encourage deliveries into LME warehouses. WARRANTS: On-warrant stocks of zinc available to the market in LME-registered warehouses have fallen by more than 50 percent this year, with a small number of entities holding most warrants. MZNSTX-TOTAL <0#LME-WHC> CHINA DEMAND: New measures to slow home sales and a downgrade of China’s long-term sovereign credit rating last week have dampened expectations of Chinese demand for metals. CHINA SUPPLY: Closures of polluting smelters have supported prices, with cities in Anhui province the latest to issue plans to curb production in the steelmaking, non-ferrous smelting, cement and coal-fired power sectors. GERMANY: Business confidence in Germany deteriorated unexpectedly in September, suggesting the economy could lose some momentum. DOLLAR: Expectations of a rise in U.S. interest rates in December could strengthen the dollar, weakness in which has fuelled demand for metals this year by making them cheaper for holders of other currencies. KOREA: Some banks are paring back credit lines to smaller trading firms holding industrial metals in South Korea because of escalating tensions over North Korea, sources said. DISCOUNTS: Traders said worries over stockpiles in South Korean warehouses had driven up discounts of cash nickel, copper and aluminium to their three-month contracts. The discounts are near multi-year highs. MNI0-3 MCU0-3 MAL0-3 SPECULATORS: Hedge funds and money managers cut their net long position in COMEX copper in the latest week. NICKEL: LME nickel finished up 1.5 percent at $10,580 a tonne after falling more than 8 percent over Thursday and Friday, when the Shanghai Futures Exchange raised trading fees to curb speculative investment. COPPER: LME copper ended 0.1 percent lower at $6,450. On Friday it touched $6,366, the lowest since Aug. 16. PRICES: Aluminium closed down 0.5 percent at $2,148 a tonne, lead finished 0.3 percent lower at $2,475 and tin ended 0.9 percent higher at $20,700.

263," (CNN)Missouri House and Senate leaders announced Thursday night that they have gathered enough support from lawmakers to call the state legislature into a special session for impeachment proceedings against Gov. Eric Greitens. The announcement follows a series of dire developments for Greitens, a former Republican rising star, including two felony charges: one stemming from a photo he allegedly took of a woman with whom he had an affair and another relating to his campaign's alleged procurement of a nonprofit donor list without the charity's knowledge. But the decision by state lawmakers to consider impeaching the governor adds a new layer to Greitens' woes given that the Statehouse is firmly controlled by his own party.  ""This path is not the one that I would have chosen for Missourians or my colleagues,"" said Missouri House Speaker Todd Richardson, a Republican. ""I have hoped from the beginning of this process that the committee would find no wrongdoing so we could bring this issue to a close. ... Unfortunately, this is where the facts led."" ""We will not avoid doing what is right just because it is hard, just because it is the path we hoped not to travel,"" Richardson added. The governor now faces three investigations into his conduct, by state Attorney General Josh Hawley, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner and a Missouri House committee led by Rep. Jay Barnes, a Republican. That House committee this week released its second report examining Greitens' conduct, divulging new details behind his campaign's use of a donor list he took from The Mission Continues, a veterans charity he founded. The report included testimony by a former campaign aide to Greitens alleging that the campaign filed a false report regarding the donor list.  The first House committee report focused on the allegations that sparked the controversy now enveloping Greitens: that he photographed a woman with whom he had an affair while she was bound and blindfolded, and blackmailed her with those photos.  Greitens has sought to frame these investigations as political witch hunts. But a roster of Missouri Republican leaders have recently called for the governor to resign, including Hawley, Richardson and US Rep. Ann Wagner. Meanwhile, few Republicans have rushed to Greitens' defense. The issue has become a lightning rod in the hotly contested race for the US Senate in Missouri, with Hawley challenging Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill for the seat. Democratic attacks have sought to frame Hawley as ""part of the problem in Jefferson City."" And the issue is not likely to fade anytime soon.  Greitens' trial for his first felony charge is set to begin May 14, before the start of a special session in the Statehouse. The regular session of the Legislature is set to end May 18. To move forward with impeachment, the Missouri House would vote first, requiring a simple majority. The process would then move to the Senate, where state lawmakers would name a panel of seven jurists to try the impeachment. Those judges would ultimately decide whether to convict Greitens. A Missouri governor has not previously been impeached.  CNN's Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report."
264,"* World stocks hover near recent peaks * European shares slip after last week’s records * Dollar index suffers third day of falls * Oil near three month highs * China rate reform, retail sales boost bullish mood * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Karin Strohecker LONDON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - World stocks clung to recent gains on Monday following healthy advances in Asia on hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal, a more optimistic growth outlook and a softer dollar, while the euro climbed to a 4-1/2 month high. Yet European stock markets failed to follow the lead and took a breather following last week’s record highs. The pan-regional Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.3% while Germany’s DAX slipped 0.5%. Banks, which had been lagging the 2019 rally, were the only sector to mark small gains in thin year-end trading. “Investors appear to be growing a tad apprehensive about chasing the record setting U.S. equity market risk-reward premise into year-end,” Stephen Innes at AxiTrader wrote in a note to clients. “Much focus continues to fall on the abundance of liquidity offered up by the Fed as a critical driver behind the late-season equity market window dressing.” Many Asian bourses had marked healthy gains with Chinese blue chips roaring 1.5% higher, bolstered by a report that 2019 retail sales are forecast to rise 8% and expectations that a new benchmark for floating-rate loans could lower borrowing costs and boost flagging economic growth. Yet Japan’s Nikkei stock index finished its last trading day of the year down 0.76%. The index gained 18.2% in 2019 after dropping 12.8% last year. Easing trade war worries have offered a lift to global equities this month, putting MSCI’s global equity index on track for a 3.8% rise in December - its fourth straight month of gains. U.S. futures also pointed to a higher open after the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at records on Friday. In currency markets, the dollar index - measuring the currency against a basket of rivals - weakened 0.1% to 96.793 in its third straight session in the red. Thin end-of-year volumes exacerbated the broad weakness in the greenback which on Friday suffered its biggest one-day fall since June. “The U.S. dollar is the worst performing G10 currency overnight,” said MUFG’s Fritz Louw. “The main drivers of the weaker dollar have likely been risk appetite holding up in the wake of comments from the U.S. pertaining to a Phase One trade deal recently as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s continued repo operations.” The weak greenback helped other currencies shine. The euro climbed as high as $1.1211, its strongest level since mid-August. Sterling also benefited, rising 0.2% to $1.3122 against the dollar. Yet the pound was flat against the euro at 85.38 pence amid concerns that Britain could be headed for a disruptive “hard Brexit” at the end of 2020. China’s yuan held below the key level of 7 per dollar, rising in offshore markets to 6.9752, its highest since Dec. 13. In fixed income markets, rising risk appetite saw euro zone bond yields rise across the board, with most 10-year bond yields two basis points higher on the day. Germany’s Bund yield stood at -0.23%, heading back towards recent six-month highs. The softer dollar also lifted commodity markets with gold hitting a two month peak. Oil prices held near three-month highs with traders also keeping a close watch on the Middle East following U.S. air strikes in Iraq and Syria against Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia group. U.S. officials said on Sunday that the attacks were successful, but warned “additional actions” may be taken to defend U.S. interests. Global benchmark Brent crude traded at $68.33 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate stood at $61.74. Oil prices were also supported by a bigger-than-expected decline in crude inventories in the United States, the world’s biggest fuel consumer. Stockpiles fell by 5.5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 20, far exceeding a 1.7-million-barrel drop forecast in a Reuters poll, government data showed on Friday.

269,"(Reuters) - Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) on Friday once again defended its decision to contract capacity on its Mainline system and said it would move forward with an open season to solicit bids if the pipeline operator wins necessary approval. The company plans to sell 90% of space under long-term contracts to shippers on the nearly 3 million barrels-per-day (bpd) Mainline, instead of continuing the older practice of rationing space monthly. With congested pipelines, some oil producers worry that Enbridge’s changes will further limit access. After two years of negotiations and changes to the contract, Enbridge has landed on a very good balance of benefits for everybody, including producers, integrated companies and refiners, Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco said on a conference call with analysts. Earlier on Friday, Enbridge posted a quarterly profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates, hit by weaker earnings at its energy services unit and liquids pipeline segment, sending its shares down more than 1%. The energy services unit, which provides marketing services to North American refiners and producers among others, swung to a loss of C$22 million ($16.60 million). Enbridge transported 1.6% more crude on its Mainline system during the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, however adjusted core earnings from Canada’s longest pipeline fell 3.7%. The headline EBITDA miss may cause some concern given robust equity outperformance, however the company hit full-year guidance and attractive defensive characteristics remain apparent, wrote analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Pipeline operators in Canada have faced strong opposition from environmental and indigenous groups, which has stalled some new pipeline projects at a time when rising production is already pressurizing existing infrastructure. Enbridge has been trying to get approvals for its Line 3 project that would replace an aging pipeline from Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin, allowing it to double capacity to 760,000 bpd. The company said it still doesn’t have clarity on when the permits will be issued but once it gets them, construction should take between six to nine months. Excluding items, Enbridge earned 61 Canadian cents per share, below analysts’ expectations of 63 Canadian cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

270,"As India continues its race to adopt digital payments at a pace and scale seen rarely worldwide, the country’s startups are quickly building solutions to bring financial services to businesses. And they are attracting significant capital from local investors and global giants to scale their ambitions. Lendingkart, one of the many startups in the country that is helping micro, small and medium-sized enterprises access working capital, has raised $30 million as part of its Series D financing round, it said on Friday. Existing investors Fullerton Financial Holdings, Bertelsmann India Investments and India Quotient funded the round. The five-year-old, Bangalore-based startup has raised $143 million to date. Lendingkart Finance has issued over 60,000 loans to more than 55,000 small and medium-sized enterprises in 1,300 cities across India. In a statement, the startup said it would use the fresh capital to widen its lending range and find new clients. It also wants to refine and bulk up its product offering. Like in other developing markets, many businesses in India, including those that are operating in the exporting space, have to wait for days before they get paid from their previous clients. This creates an immense challenge for many who don’t have any savings. Their options are severely limited as traditional banks find them too risky to lend money. “Micro and small businesses represent a vibrant yet underserved segment of the Indian economy. The support of all of our customers, investors and employees is empowering us to build the leading financial services platform for this segment,” said Harshvardhan Lunia, co-founder and managing director of Lendingkart. Lendingkart competes with a handful of businesses, including Gurgaon-based Indifi, which raised $21 million earlier this week, Bangalore-based Zest Money, Five Star Finance, Capital Float and, in some capacity, Drip Capital, which recently raised $25 million."

272,"IndyCar drivers return to Pocono with Wilson, Clauson in their hearts LONG POND, Pa. — It figures to be emotional for the Verizon IndyCar Series this weekend at Pocono Raceway. If the reminder of Justin Wilson’s fatal accident nearly a year ago at this oval track isn’t enough, this will be the series’ first official gathering since three-time Indianapolis 500 starter Bryan Clauson succumbed to injuries suffered in a USAC midget race Aug. 6 in Belleville, Kan. Clauson will be honored this weekend by his most recent IndyCar team, Dale Coyne Racing, which will have Conor Daly’s car using Clauson’s No. 88 and both team cars will carry “BC Forever” decals. Pippa Mann will drive the team’s other car, No. 19. Wilson was driving the last of the cars to enter Sage Karam’s crash scene last year, and he had the Andretti Autosport car sufficiently slowed down. But the nose cone of Karam’s car came down out of the sky and struck Wilson in the helmet in a fluke accident. That happened on Aug. 23, 2015, and Wilson died the next day in a Lehigh Valley hospital. IndyCar responded by tethering several of the larger pieces in the front end of these cars, including the nose cones. Also, extensive work has gone into the research and development of a windshield, although series officials don’t have a timeframe on when the safety pieces could be implemented. Wilson was as popular as popular gets, a leader within the paddock and a friend to all. He also was an accomplished driver, having won seven races and eight poles in IndyCar, which he joined after a stint in Formula One. Wilson left behind a wife and two young daughters, which makes what happened all the more tragic. Julia Wilson said she intends to spend the weekend near their Longmont, Colo., home away from as many people as possible. Graham Rahal said Wilson’s memory has been kept alive by the IndyCar community. “The thing about Justin is that he was a damn good guy, and he drove the same as he was outside the car,” Rahal said. “He was a good guy to race with, a good guy to hang out with. From top to bottom, class and dignity stood out with him. “Without him you lack a guy who was the best and everybody knew that. It’s frustrating that he’s been gone. It would be nice to hear his voice and ask him questions, get some advice from him as I always did. But I’m sure it’s a lot harder for Julia and the girls than it is for the rest of us. It’s going to be a tough weekend for them.” Ryan Hunter-Reay won last year’s ABC Supply 500 race at Pocono Raceway as one of Wilson’s teammates on the Michael Andretti-owned team. He said returning will be an emotional challenge. “I think about him all the time, but (being there) it’s right in your face,” Hunter-Reay said. “As race car drivers we learn to compartmentalize it and just put it where it needs to be, but this will be different, for sure.” Hunter-Reay not only wants to return to victory lane to honor Wilson, but such a result is what the team needs to regain positive momentum. The team’s only win this season was the Indianapolis 500, won by series rookie Alexander Rossi, and mostly the four-car operation has struggled. Teammates Marco Andretti and Carlos Munoz are similarly in need of a career-invigorating weekend. Simon Pagenaud takes a 58-point lead over Team Penske teammate Will Power into the weekend, which will see practice and qualifying Saturday and the 200-lap, 500-mile race on Sunday (3 p.m. ET, NBCSN). There are four races left this season, and this is the start of three consecutive race weekends. The oval race at Texas Motor Speedway, postponed by rain in June, will be made up Aug. 27, and IndyCar will make its return to the Watkins Glen (N.Y.) International road course Sept. 4. IndyCar last raced at Watkins Glen in 2010. IndyCar recently confirmed it will return to Pocono for races in 2017 and ‘18."
273,"A software glitch that could have destroyed the capsule was fixed in orbit, during an uncrewed December test flight that had already gone awry. An uncrewed test flight of a Boeing spacecraft designed to carry NASA astronauts may have narrowly avoided catastrophic failure in December. A software error that could have resulted in loss of the spacecraft was discovered and fixed while the capsule, known as Starliner, was in orbit, and not long before it returned to Earth. During a telephone news conference on Friday, Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, said that the mission “had a lot of anomalies,” but that it was important that the agency continue to work with Boeing to fix them. The agency is conducting an ongoing review with the company to assess what went wrong. But Douglas Loverro, NASA’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said that the review had already found multiple failures in Boeing’s processes that should have caught the mistakes on the ground. “It told us that we have a more fundamental problem,” he said, not just the flaws that were identified this week. Boeing will now review 1 million lines of Starliner software code. Officials from the company declined to speculate how long that might take. Neither the agency nor the company would set a schedule for when the Starliner capsule would be ready to carry astronauts to space. But Mr. Bridenstine said that NASA needs more than one way for getting astronauts to the International Space Station. The agency has also hired SpaceX, which has developed a different spacecraft, Crew Dragon, to transport astronauts. The additional software problem, first publicly reported Thursday during a meeting of NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, is the second major flaw known to have marred Starliner’s trip in December, the first orbital flight of the spacecraft. During its trip to orbit, the spacecraft set its clock to the wrong time, causing it to deplete its propellant. A planned docking at the space station was called off, and the mission was cut short, to two days instead of eight. Because of the clock problem, Boeing engineers started searching to see if there were other flaws in the software. On the evening before landing, they found one. “It is our belief we wouldn’t have found it if we hadn’t gone looking,” said Jim Chilton, senior vice president of the space and launch division at Boeing, which is distinct from its segment that manufactures jet planes. The newly disclosed flaw, described by Boeing in a statement as “a valve mapping software issue,” would have bumbled Starliner’s preparations for re-entry. Had it not been corrected, the wrong thrusters would have fired as Starliner jettisoned its service module, the part of the spacecraft that carries systems that are not needed for the descent through the atmosphere. That could have caused the service module to bump into the crew module. The impact could have caused the capsule to tumble, or damaged its heat shield. Those problems could have destroyed the capsule during re-entry. Engineers on Earth were able to fix the software problem within a few hours of finding it. An investigation team has found the cause of the incorrect time problem that emerged during the December flight; Starliner gets that information from the Atlas 5 rocket that propels it to orbit. Because of the programming error, the spacecraft queried the rocket too early, before the clock had been properly set. The team is still diagnosing additional communications problems that prevented flight controllers from sending commands promptly several times during the flight. That might be associated with noise from cellphone towers on Earth that broadcast at a similar frequency. Since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011, NASA astronauts have had to ride on Russia’s Soyuz rockets, trips that now cost more than $80 million per seat. Instead of developing and operating its own successor to the shuttles, NASA turned to commercial companies, awarding contracts in 2014 to Boeing and SpaceX. The agency hoped that the spacecraft would be ready by the end of 2017. Both companies have run into technical issues that delayed their schedules. In January, SpaceX successfully demonstrated the escape system on its capsule, Crew Dragon, that would ferry astronauts away from the rocket in the event of a failure during launch. The December flight was to be the last major technical hurdle before Boeing would be cleared for taking astronauts to space. The investigation is expected to last until the end of February, and NASA is also analyzing data gathered during the flight. Mr. Loverro acknowledged that NASA failed to identify the weaknesses in Boeing’s work. “Our NASA oversight was insufficient,” he said. “That’s obvious, and we recognize that. I think that’s good learning for us.” NASA is currently pushing for similar commercial approach for developing landers to take astronauts to the surface of the moon. “We are going to have far more insight and oversight” on those much more complicated missions, he said. NASA could require Boeing to fly another uncrewed test, and the company took a $410 million charge against its earnings last quarter in case it has to pay for that. Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world."

275,"This week, the CRISPR-Cas9 patent case came to a close, an encrypted messaging app went open source and Facebook announced some big changes to its video product. These are some of the notable stories in tech from this week. You can also receive this post as a weekly newsletter, delivered to your inbox on Saturday mornings. 1. A judge has determined that CRISPR-Cas9 patents belong to the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, not UC Berkeley. In what was a heated court hearing over ownership of these gene-editing patents, the ruling suggests that Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier’s work at UC Berkeley was not distinct enough. The important piece for Doudna is that everyone can at least start to move forward in applying the technology. “In the end, as scientists, we would all like to see this technology help people and ultimately that’s got to be the goal that we all have,” she told TechCrunch. 2. Mark Zuckerberg released a 5,000 word letter to the “global community” outlining what he calls the next phase of Facebook’s mission: support, safety, information, civic engagement and inclusion. Some argue that this sprawling letter is just another feel-good effort put forth by the CEO to appear introspective, and that the real story may be in what was left out of the manifesto. 3. Disney-owned Maker Studios cut ties with PewDiePie, YouTube’s top star, over a series of videos he posted containing anti-Semitic clips and messages. Soon after, the vlogger’s YouTube Red reality series was cancelled. Here’s what PewDiePie had to say. 4. Facebook really wants users to upload and consume more video content, and the network’s video platform has been evolving for some time now. Facebook VP of partnerships Dan Rose announced that the company is launching a series of apps for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV. The announcement also came with the news that Facebook video will adhere to the audio settings of whatever device a video is being viewed on. So if your sound is on, audio will play. Facebook also will no longer crop vertical video, and a new feature will allow users to pull a video to the side of the feed while they continue scrolling. 5. Thinking about buying Snap stock? Goodwater Capital, a two-year old venture firm, released a comprehensive report of pre-IPO Snap. The snapshot contains a business overview, key trends, summary financials, projections and lots of useful graphics and charts. 6. It’s no secret that Twitter has a growth problem. But the company also has an ad revenue issue, as evidenced by its last earnings report in which YoY ad revenue declined in the millions. We learned that Twitter is reassessing some of its direct response business, Promoted Tweets and the TellApart business. None of these products have been shuttered, but sources say Twitter is beginning to isolate products that aren’t getting advertiser buy-in, and could stop supporting them. 7. Considering the size of the cloud market, AWS is the undeniable leader — but how did the company achieve its status of dominance over companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM and Oracle? AWS CEO Andy Jassy says success can be attributed to disruption dynamics. The competition simply didn’t believe there was enough of a market to be concerned about, so they didn’t build fast enough. 8. Facebook Jobs has arrived. Facebook Business pages will now be able to post job openings to the News Feed, as well as host them on a Jobs tab. LinkedIn has not offered options for people seeking part-time or hourly jobs, and Facebook has stepped in to fill this gap. 9. Encrypted messaging app Wickr has gone open source. The app is publishing its code for Wickr Professional, the subscription-based enterprise version of its free messaging app, for public inspection. This is notable because “by opening their code, they are giving the engineering community strong reasons to trust their platform,” says security expert Dan Kaminsky. 10. Former VP of marketing at Magic Leap Tannen Campbell was originally brought into the augmented reality startup to help improve the billion-dollar company’s appeal to women. Now, she is suing Magic Leap for sexual discrimination."
276,"(changes sourcing, adds company comments) DUBAI, April 8 (Reuters) - Dubai Islamic Bank, the United Arab Emirates’ largest sharia-compliant bank, is in talks with shareholders of unlisted Dubai-based Noor Bank over a possible acquisition of the lender, three sources said on Monday. “The talks are at a shareholder level,” said one of the sources, who was familiar the discussions. Dubai’s sovereign investment group, Investment Corp of Dubai (ICD) - a common shareholder in the two banks - will likely make a decision on any successful deal between DIB and Noor bank, a second source said. ICD owns 28.37 percent of DIB and more than 22.7 percent of Noor Bank. Other Noor Bank shareholders include members of the ruling family of Dubai and a group of Dubai government nominated UAE nationals. Bloomberg reported late Sunday the talks were taking place, citing people with knowledge of the discussions. DIB and Noor bank said in separate statements that they do not comment on market speculation. ICD wasn’t immediately available to comment. The latest talks come during a wave of mergers in the UAE’s banking sector as tougher competition and regulatory standards coupled with a slowing economy and a slide in house prices. “We believe that consolidation would be positive for UAE banks from a return generation and cost perspective,” Goldman Sachs said in a note. “This is especially true given the fragmented nature of the market.” After two of the UAE’s biggest lenders, First Gulf Bank and National Bank of Abu Dhabi, merged in 2017 to become First Abu Dhabi Bank, three more lenders have agreed to combine, led by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. Bank consolidation has also picked up in other Gulf countries, notably Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain as profit margins have been squeezed by lower government and consumer spending in the face of volatile oil prices. UAE has 50 commercial banks including 22 local lenders, a number viewed as too high in a country of about 9.5 million people. Saudi Arabia, which has a population of 32 million, has 12 banks and is set to lose two of those if announced mergers are successfully concluded.

277,"NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global index provider MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) is seeking feedback from market participants on whether to add Chinese shares to a widely tracked index, a move which could trigger billions of dollars in capital inflows into mainland stocks and ease pressure on its yuan currency. MSCI did not add Chinese shares to its Emerging Markets Index, for a third year running in 2016, citing concerns over share suspension rules and monthly limits on repatriating capital.. The emerging index is tracked by $1.6 trillion in global assets. In a 15-slide presentation posted on its website, MSCI highlighted the concerns raised last year, the steps China has taken to address those questions and key discussion points posed to investors. here China has removed quota limits on its landmark stock connect programs between Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai, and reduced the number of shares which are suspended to levels seen before a market crash in mid-2015. Hong Kong and China shares pulled off lows on expectations that the new proposals, which would include large-cap stocks but exclude dual-listed shares among others, would be more acceptable to global investors.[.SS][.HK] If the proposed new rules are applied, the number of Chinese stocks that would have to be included would drop dramatically by two-thirds to 169 stocks leading to a sharp drop in market turnover, a crucial source of costs for passive funds. MSCI will also take a decision on whether to reclassify the Argentina index as an emerging markets index. The country has been classified as a frontier market since 2009.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days. Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved. (Compiled by Brussels newsroom)"
282," (CNN)Celebration and pride turned into tragedy for a small city in Alabama after gunfire erupted during a high school graduation party.  One person was killed and eight others were wounded at a community center in Atmore, near the Florida border, early Saturday. Witnesses say a fight broke out between two women during a graduation party for Escambia County High School's seniors. As people were trying to separate the two women, police said, gunshots were fired inside that hit several people. Atmore Police Chief Chuck Brooks told CNN officers responded to a 911 call for shots fired at the community center around 2 a.m. Saturday. Once officers got to the scene, shots were still being fired and police found one man dead in the center's cafeteria. The shooting was at a former middle school transformed into a community center, police said.  The eight wounded people were taken to a local hospital for treatment.  The suspects fled the scene and are still at large, Brooks said.  The high school's principal, Dennis Fuqua, said in a statement Saturday the community ""felt the pangs of tragedy due to the acts of violence that have left several of our past and present students injured."" ""It is unfortunate that the event at the community center has tainted the success our seniors and football team felt, but we love our Blue Devil Family and will continue to pray for wisdom and healing,"" Fuqua said.

285,"Android creator Andy Rubin's consumer electronics startup Essential will shutter its operations, the company announced in a blog post Wednesday.The company pointed to troubles with its latest product as the reason for the shutdown, saying that while the product was developed, it saw ""no clear path to deliver it to customers."" The three-year old company was initially lauded as a promising technology startup, but struggled as its product the Essential Phone failed to gain traction. Rubin's departure from Google following allegations of sexual misconduct also dogged the company. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Android creator and former Google executive Andy Rubin's consumer electronics startup Essential will shutter its operations, the company announced in a blog post Wednesday.


Essential said that it could see no way to deliver its latest product, a mobile handset named 'Project Gem,' to the market - so it decided to shut down the company entirely.  ""Despite our best efforts, we've now taken Gem as far as we can and regrettably have no clear path to deliver it to customers. Given this, we have made the difficult decision to cease operations and shutdown Essential,"" the blog post said. The three-year old company was initially seen as one of Silicon Valley's most promising ventures thanks to Rubin's track record in developing Android, the open-source smartphone manufacturer acquired by Google. It became a a so-called unicorn, a startup valued at more than $1 billion, in less than two years. But when its first product, the Essential Phone, failed to gain traction with consumers, the company struggled. It was forced to slash down its smartphone's price by $200, and later reportedly cancelled the development of a smart home device and laid off 30% of its staff. 


The company was also dogged by negative publicity, after the circumstances of Rubin's departure from Google were revealed by a New York Times report and proceeded to ignite a walkout against sexual harassment. The Times article described how Google had paid Rubin a $90 million severance package after he was accused of coercing a fellow employee at the search giant of performing oral sex. Rubin on Twitter denied the accusation, calling it and other parts of the story ""false allegations"" that were part of ""a smear campaign against him.""The company only released two products to the market since 2016: the Essential Phone and a cross-platform email app. It said that the smartphone would continue to work for users, but it would not be providing any updates or customer support. Meanwhile, its email app will be cancelled after April 30th, 2020.  Essential did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

286,"April 24 (Reuters) - Infosys Ltd, India’s second biggest software services exporter, is in the process of expanding its board of directors by inducting two more members, CNBC TV18 reported on Monday. The report said that the company’s founders are in the process of submitting their list of candidates to the company’s lawyers. The lawyers will submit a list of probables to the board’s nomination and remuneration committee, who in turn will short-list contenders. Earlier this year, the company said it had retained well known Indian law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas to engage with the company’s founders and former executives, who have publicly criticized the company’s corporate governance practices. Earlier this month, Infosys appointed independent director Ravi Venkatesan as its co-chair, in a move seen as an attempt to placate its founders and former executives. The TV report on Monday said chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath was a contender to be one of the two new additions to the Infosys board. The final decision rests with the board, the report said. Infosys was not immediately reachable for comment on the matter. Infosys chairman R. Seshasayee has previously said Infosys is “looking for appropriate and competent people to be added on to the board. We would certainly, in course of time, would be expanding the board.” Infosys currently has a 10 member board.

289,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Southern Airlines has signed a deal to buy 38 aircraft from U.S. planemaker Boeing Co with a combined price tag of $5.65 billion, the Chinese carrier said on Friday. China’s largest airline by passenger numbers has agreed to buy 8 B777-300ER wide body jets and 30 B737-8 narrow bodies, the Chinese firm said in a stock exchange filing. The planes will be delivered between 2019 and 2020 and will be funded through China Southern’s own funds and loans from commercial banks, the company said. The carrier said the deal would help its “two hub” strategy with plans for a presence at a second major airport being built in Beijing as well as its hub in southern Guangzhou. It added this would “boost the firm’s competitiveness in the market”. The new Beijing airport is scheduled to open in October 2019. It will relieve pressure on Beijing’s existing international airport, currently the world’s second largest by passenger volume. Two of China’s three major airlines, China Southern and China Eastern Airlines Corp, will relocate to the airport on completion, accounting for roughly four-fifths of the new airport’s total traffic. China Southern said the actual price it would end up paying for the Boeing aircraft was still under negotiation, but that it would likely be substantially lower than the listed price as is customary for major airlines. In April, China Southern signed a deal worth nearly $6 billion to buy 20 aircraft from Boeing’s European rival, Airbus SE. Airbus has lagged Boeing in net orders in the first nine months of the year, with 271 at the end of September versus 498 for its U.S. rival. Reporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Nick Macfie"

Sommers, who is now the CEO of the American Investment Council, a group representing the private equity industry, is in line to replace long-time API president and CEO Jack Gerard, according to multiple reports. The decision will be final once it's approved by API's board of directors. “The successor to Jack Gerard will be announced at the appropriate time once the committee has completed its work,"" Eric Wohlschlegel said in a statement to The Hill, identical to one sent to both Bloomberg and Axios.  Sommers did not respond to an email asking for confirmation.  Gerard will officially step down at the end of August.  The head of API is one of the most prominent and prestigious positions in Washington's advocacy industry. In 2016, Sommers received a total compensation of about $1.5 million at the American Investment Council, an organization with $7 million in revenue. By contrast, Gerard earned nearly $6.8 million that same year.  API, which represents a large swath of the oil and gas industry, takes in $229.7 million in revenue, making it a powerhouse. Last year, it spent about $7.5 million on lobbying, making it one of the top 50 spenders on advocacy in Washington.

But Boeing ""quietly"" stopped adding the insulating caps five years ago, and stopped adding the copper foil in March of this year, the Times reported.The FAA first rejected Boeing&aposs proposal to remove the foil in February, according to The Seattle Times. It then ruled that Boeing had not shown that the fuel tank igniting when it was hit by lightning was ""extremely improbable.""But the Times reported that around 40 sets of the plane&aposs wings had already been built without the foil at that stage.DeFazio said in his November letter: ""If accurate, that is an astonishing fact that suggests either willful neglect of the Federal aviation regulatory structure or an oversight system in need of desperate repair.""He also noted: ""Lightning strikes on aircraft are a fairly routine occurrence.""Boeing appealed the FAA&aposs decision, which it then reversed one week later, allowing the planes to fly with the changes, the Times reported.







Thomas Thorson, a senior FAA safety engineer, formally objected to the FAA&aposs reversal, the Times reported.""I do not agree that delivery schedules should influence our safety decisions and areas of safety critical findings, nor is this consistent with our safety principles,"" he wrote.Boeing said in a statement to The Seattle Times that the 787 has ""several other layers of protection from lightning strikes"" and that each design change ""was properly considered and addressed by Boeing, thoroughly reviewed with and approved by the FAA.""DeFazio&aposs November letter said that the FAA asked Boeing to perform a risk assessment of the change to ""determine if any corrective actions to reduce the risk of a fuel tank explosion should be required.""He said the committee was ""deeply concerned"" by this:""While we appreciate that the FAA is finally taking some action on this issue, we are deeply concerned that the agency is just now asking Boeing to provide analysis to enable the FAA &aposto determine if any corrective actions&apos are required.""It appears Boeing took actions that may have violated FAA requirements in the first place by taking unilateral steps to change the design of the aircraft&aposs lightning protection system.""Asking Boeing to now review its own work in the aftermath of those events, if true, to help the FAA determine what corrective actions Boeing may need to take seems woefully inadequate to ensure the safety of the flying public.""Scrutiny of the 787 comes as the FAA faces heavy scrutiny over the 737 Max, which is the main subject of Wednesday&aposs House hearing with the FAA administrator.The FAA gave Boeing a lot of control over the certification of the 737 Max, which went on to be involved in two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. The crashes revealed design issues with the plane and left the aircraft grounded around the world while Boeing works on an update. 







This certification delegation is in line with the FAA&aposs practices as approved by Congress over the years, but it has come under renewed political scrutiny.DeFazio said in his letter that both the 737 Max and the changes to the 787 ""suggest that the opinions and expert advice of the FAA&aposs safety and technical experts are being circumvented or sidelined while the interests of Boeing are being elevated by FAA senior management.""

294,"Asia Pacific Edition Good morning. We’re trying something new for our readers in Asia and Australia: a morning briefing to jump-start your day. What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes.com. Here’s what you need to know: • The contentious American presidential race is fracturing the Republican Party. Donald J. Trump and his allies are turning on Republican leaders in Congress with an intensity that sometimes matches their battle against Hillary Clinton. The latest hacked emails from WikiLeaks reveal worries about Clinton Foundation donations hurting Mrs. Clinton’s political future. (The Clinton and Trump foundations are vastly different.) Mr. Trump has begun engaging in barely veiled promotions of his business brand, pulling reporters to his marquee properties between his campaign events. On Wednesday, he held a ribbon-cutting at his five-star hotel near the White House. And Mr. Trump inaugurated a Facebook-only talk show that is helping stoke speculation that he is planning to start his own network after the election. • President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines used his state visit to Japan to ratchet up his anti-American remarks. “I want them out,” Mr. Duterte said of the United States troops in his country, adding that he was willing to “revise or abrogate agreements” on military bases. But deep cultural, economic and military ties make upending the alliance unlikely. • Russia abruptly withdrew its application to dock three warships for refueling at a Spanish port in the Mediterranean, after NATO members urged Spain to turn the vessels away. The ships are en route to support Russian military operations in Syria. • The Islamic State is under siege in Syria and Iraq, but its influence is still felt around the world. Fighters linked to the terror group seized a port town in Somalia, and a group of gunmen who claimed allegiance to the group executed 23 civilian hostages in western Afghanistan. • “Incredibly lucky.” That was our photographer, who was covering Iraqi forces’ push toward Mosul when his convoy was hit by a suicide car bomb. This is his account, with photos and videos. • Australia will suffer from drought, more extremely hot days and a longer and fiercer fire season, the county’s top weather scientists say. The report offers a snapshot to countries around the world of the challenges of climate change. • ZTO Express, the Chinese delivery service, is coming to Wall Street in what many expect to be the biggest initial public offering of the year. ZTO’s top customer is the e-commerce giant Alibaba. • Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy Note 7 debacle virtually wiped out third-quarter profit at its mobile division. The company said it expected the division to recover in the coming quarter. • Recalled Takata airbags are still circulating freely in used cars in the United States, especially at auctions, the least-regulated rung of the market. • A glut of cash in Europe and Asia that is being pumped into the U.S. bond market has many economists warning of a looming crisis. They say the situation echoes a wave of investment in the years before last decade’s financial meltdown. • U.S. markets were lower, led by real estate shares. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • China is holding military drills in an area of the South China Sea today and has ordered all other shipping to avoid the zone. [Reuters] • Dreamworld, the Australian theme park, said it would reopen this week with a “Memorial Day” for the four adults who were killed on a ride. [BBC] • The Afghan woman whose photograph as a young refugee was published on the cover of National Geographic in 1985 was arrested in Pakistan for trying to obtain illegal identity cards. [The New York Times] • Hong Kong’s legislative council was thrown into chaos and adjourned again as two barred lawmakers stormed into the chamber with supporters. [South China Morning Post] • China instituted the one-child policy on this day in 1982 and suspended it a year ago. A new study in a British medical journal predicts no baby boom and a peak population of 1.45 billion in 2029. [CCTV] • Five officials with the environmental protection agency in Xian, China, have been detained for tampering with air-quality devices and falsifying data. [The Straits Times] • Mount Fuji tied a record for the latest date it has ever been capped by snow. Japan began keeping track of the event in 1894; the record was set in 1956. [Asahi Shimbun] • AIDS arrived in the U.S. long before “Patient Zero.” [The New York Times] • Relocating the 6,000 or more people who had been living in “The Jungle” encampment in Calais has exposed France’s divided view of migrants. [The New York Times] • The original set of 176 emojis, created by the Japanese mobile provider NTT DoCoMo and released in 1999, is now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. • We’ve all lied once or twice to spare someone’s feelings, but a new study looks at how fibbing could turn into serial dishonesty. • The surfing world knew John John Florence was the best. Now it’s official. How much is a rat’s life worth? The universally loathed rodent is a frequent target of eradication programs in cities worldwide. Jakarta is the latest metropolis attempting to eliminate the urban pest to prevent outbreaks of diseases. Officials say they will offer a bounty of about $1.50 a rat. That’s a bump from Paris’s offer of a nickel in 1920 (about 60 cents today) during its war on the animal. The Times reported then about a hunter using explosives who handed in about 250 tails. But it was a hoax. The police learned they were made of string and rubber. About 20 years later, the going rate for rat was just 2 cents in Chongqing, China. Humans were enlisted to help after it was said the rodents used their whiskers to poison the dogs sent to exterminate them. There are twists on the financial incentives to wipe out invasive species. Fishermen in Jamaica have reaped the benefits of a demand for lionfish on dinner plates. And prize money is offered in a Florida contest aimed at culling the state’s Burmese python population. Contestants there are allowed to use guns, but that’s something Jakarta’s deputy governor hopes to avoid. “If you miss your shot,” he warned, “the bullets could hit other people.” Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.

295,"She was an engaged member of her New Hampshire community: the sort of local who purchased a lotto ticket at a quaint, modest market that some say makes the “best subs in town.” That Powerball ticket, though, turned out to be worth $560 million — the seventh largest jackpot in this country’s lottery history. And, according to a lawsuit filed late last month, now all the winner wants is her anonymity — the simple “freedom to walk into a grocery store or attend public events without being known or targeted,” the lawsuit says. So the winner of the Jan. 6 drawing, referred to in the lawsuit as Jane Doe, is going to court, arguing that New Hampshire lottery officials would be irreparably invading her privacy if they disclose her identity as a result of the state’s “Right to Know” law. “As a lottery jackpot winner, Ms. Doe is now part of a small demographic which has historically been victimized by the unscrupulous with life threatening consequences,” the lawsuit says. It continues, “The limited public interest in disclosure is far outweighed by Ms. Doe’s interest in remaining anonymous.” The Powerball game is played in 44 states; Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico; and the United States Virgin Islands. Most states consider the identities of winners of large prizes to be a matter of public record, though a few — like Delaware, Kansas and Maryland — allow winners to keep their identities private; others allow trusts, instead of individuals, to claim prizes. Over the years, lawmakers from various states have grappled with where on the spectrum to fall. Jane Doe’s lawsuit says that the New Hampshire Lottery Commission has, in the past, allowed a trustee to be the public face of a jackpot, and seeks a court order allowing the winner in this case to do the same thing. The problem is that Jane Doe has already signed her winning ticket — a decision she now calls “a huge mistake” — so she is asking that she be allowed to white-out her information and replace it with the name of a trust in the presence of the lottery commission. The request was denied, the lawsuit says. Steven M. Gordon, the lawyer for Jane Doe, said in an email on Wednesday that he and his team “are in conversations with the attorney general’s office” and had no additional comment. The Office of the Attorney General could not be reached Wednesday night, and the status of the lawsuit in Hillsborough County Superior Court was not clear. In a statement, Charlie McIntyre, the New Hampshire Lottery Commission executive director, said that while officials understand that winning a huge Powerball jackpot is life-changing, “the procedures in place for prize claimants are critically important for the security and integrity of the lottery, our players and our games.” “While we respect this player’s desire to remain anonymous, state statutes and lottery rules clearly dictate protocols,” Mr. McIntyre said. “After consulting with the New Hampshire attorney general’s office on this matter, we have been advised that the Lottery must proceed in accordance its rules and by state law in processing this claim like any other.” The notion of sudden, incredible wealth is so universally tantalizing that it has served as the backdrop for movies like “Brewster’s Millions” (1985), with Richard Pryor, and “Lottery Ticket” (2010), starring Bow Wow. And the same mythology that surrounds winning the lottery haunts its aftermath. One influential study in 1978 reported that lottery winners were not any happier than their neighbors or more optimistic about the future. Subsequent studies, however, have mostly debunked the idea of a lottery “curse” — suggesting that although winners’ happiness and well-being may decline in the first months after they cash in, their psychological situation more than rebounds over time. Lawyers for Jane Doe write ominously in the lawsuit about six cases in which lottery winners became the victims of harassment, fraud or even violence after being identified. Like many big winners, she “intends to contribute a portion of her winnings to a charitable foundation, so that they may do good in the world,” the lawsuit says. “She wishes to be a silent witness to these good works, far from the glare and misfortune that has often fallen upon other lottery ‘winners.’”"
296,"MONOPOLIES ARE GOOD—so long as they can be challenged, however remote the possibility. That belief has long held sway at the University of Chicago, a bastion of free-market thinking, which helped make the word “antitrust” lose most of its meaning in America, not least with respect to technology. “Punishing Google for being a successful competitor would stifle innovation and dynamic competition,” concluded the late Robert Bork, long the Chicago school’s leading antitrust expert, in a paper published in 2012 (commissioned by Google, which needed ammunition to defend itself in an antitrust investigation at the time). Now this monopoly of thought is itself being disrupted from within. In April, for the second time in as many years, Booth, the university’s business school, invited leading antitrust thinkers to discuss monopolies, this time in tech. And many came, from representatives of the old Chicago school, such as Dennis Carlton, to tech’s most ardent foes, such as Barry Lynn and Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute, a think-tank. Ideas about what should be done were disparate, including such proposals as creating property rights for data and treating social media as a public-health problem because of their addictive qualities. In his winding-up speech Luigi Zingales, one of the organisers, proposed the creation of an interdisciplinary committee for internet-platform regulation. If it is ever convened, what should it focus on? Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Information technology comes in cycles, each giving rise to a new computing platform. In the current cycle, the key component—or the next platform—is data. Facebook may have started as a social network, Google as a search engine and Microsoft as a maker of operating systems and other software. But today they all deal in data, not least to target advertisements. And now the firms are quickly becoming fully fledged data distilleries: they suck up as much digital information as they can, crunch it in vast data centres and turn it into artificial-intelligence services. At the three firms’ annual developer conferences in early May, AI was everywhere. New services unveiled included one by Microsoft to interpret people’s offline movements and one by Google which is able to call hair salons and other local businesses to make appointments. The strange thing about data is that they are an inexhaustible resource: the more you have, the more you get. More information lets firms develop better services, which attracts more users, which in turn generate more data. Having a lot of data helps those firms expand into new areas, as Facebook is now trying to do with online dating. Online platforms can use their wealth of data to spot potential rivals early and take pre-emptive action or buy them up. So big piles of data can become a barrier to competitors entering the market, says Maurice Stucke of the University of Tennessee. That said, there are other ways of looking at data. Geoffrey Manne of Northwestern University argues that, unlike physical resources, they are not rivalrous, meaning they can be collected and used by different parties without causing a clash of interests. It is not the data that are valuable, he says, but the services powered by them. Some firms are just better at developing new offerings than others. Still, assuming, as many economists in the field now do, that data matter quite a bit, what can regulators do to limit their power? Broadly, possible actions fall into two buckets, one more Hamiltonian, the other more Jeffersonian, to stick with the labels of Frank Pasquale of the University of Maryland mentioned earlier in this report. Of the two, the first is the more straightforward. When Facebook took over WhatsApp, a popular messaging service, for about $23bn in 2014, the deal barely raised any eyebrows in antitrust quarters. Today the acquisition would probably be blocked, because it has since become clear that Facebook was taking over a serious rival. And despite promises to the contrary, the social network proceeded to merge some of the two firms’ data, which last year earned it a fine of €110m ($122m at the time) from European Commission regulators. As well as blocking new mergers, this approach could involve unwinding some that have already happened. One proposal tabled in Chicago was to require Facebook to spin off WhatsApp and Instagram, another popular social-media app which it took over in 2012. Whether it makes sense to split up the firms’ core business is a different question; equipped with the same data set, one of the successor generation would probably end up dominant again after a few years. A related idea being considered is to block big online firms from offering certain services on top of their platforms because they might favour them over rival offerings. Such a conflict of interest was at the core of an antitrust case in Brussels in which Google was accused of having discriminated against competing comparison-shopping services and fined €2.4bn. Amazon, too, often competes with merchants that use its online marketplace. To avoid such conflicts, limitations have been imposed in other industries, such as railways and banking, points out Lina Khan of the Open Markets Institute. Why, she argues, should this not be possible for platforms? The second, Jeffersonian bucket is variously labelled “data sharing”, “data portability” and, in geekish, “regulation by API” (application programming interface). The champions of data monopolies accept that they will be hard to avoid and even harder to take apart, so they want incumbents to be required to give startups access to some of their data and thus create more competition. Some of the proposed measures already exist. Both Facebook and Google allow users to export many of the data they hold on them. Europe’s new privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, now mandates “data portability” (as well as a “right to be forgotten”, which requires firms to delete personal data if a user asks). But so far not many are clicking the download button, mainly because of the dearth of services that allow such data to be uploaded. This is why some want to push this approach further. Mr Zingales and Guy Rolnik, another organiser of the Chicago conference, have suggested that dominant social networks should be required to allow access to their social graphs, the network of connections between friends, to make things easier for competitors. In the early days of social media this sort of data-sharing was possible. Instagram, for instance, asked new users to import a list of their Twitter followers. Viktor Mayer-Schönberger of Oxford University would like to introduce a “progressive data-sharing mandate”. If a company’s market share reaches a certain threshold of, say, 10%, it would have to start sharing some of its “feedback data” (information collected from people using AI services). When the market share increases, so would the sharing requirement. “When feedback data from large players is available to smaller competitors, then innovation...is not concentrated at the top,” he argues in “Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data”, a new book co-written with Thomas Ramge, a journalist. Albert Wenger of Union Square Ventures, a venture-capital firm, calls for a “right to an API key”. This would not just give users real-time access to their data but allow them to plug into the inner workings of a service. A good example is Twitter in its early days: people had the choice of different applications that linked into the microblogging service. All these suggestions raise two big questions. One is whether any of them are workable. The measures in the first option seem feasible, although merger controls can be sidestepped. The proposals under the second approach could stymie innovation. As for the third, what type of data should be shared, and in which format? And how can the tension between data-sharing and privacy be resolved? Much will depend on how regulators interpret the GDPR, but the legislation does not seem to condone the idea of exporting your social graph because it includes personal information on your friends. The other big question is whether any of these ideas can be made to fit with existing antitrust law. Critics of the tech titans have not spent much time thinking about that, says Carl Shapiro of the University of California, Berkeley. Before regulators can limit data power, for instance, they have to show that it has been abused, which will be tricky. So far only one big data-related antitrust investigation has been launched, by Germany’s Federal Cartel Office. In December it found that Facebook had abused its dominant position by getting users to agree to let the firm collect personal data from other websites. Many participants at the Chicago conference called for a big trial that could put the spotlight on firms’ practices, as the Microsoft case did in the 2000s. In Europe this is a distinct possibility. Data “can foreclose the market—they can give the parties that have them immense business opportunities that are not available to others,” said Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, in a recent interview. In April she announced an investigation into Apple’s proposed acquisition of Shazam, a popular smartphone app that identifies songs. This would give the iPhone-maker access to data that could help it poach customers from rivals such as Spotify. But in America a major case seems unlikely to be brought, even if the Democrats regain power in Washington, DC. The recent techlash notwithstanding, the online giants still have many left-leaning friends, and have contributed to Democratic campaigns. So in the absence of any quick technical or regulatory fixes to the internet’s centralisation, what can be done?"
297,"LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said the central bank would not raise interest rates for the sake of meeting its 2 percent inflation target if it risked hurting the economy, in an interview published on Monday. Broadbent said raising rates could lead to “undesirable consequences” such as lower economic growth and higher unemployment, BBC News quoted him as saying. His comments were similar to those of Governor Mark Carney, who said on Friday he was willing to allow inflation to run “a bit” higher than the target to help the economy grow. British inflation is expected to rise sharply in 2017 as the impact of the fall in the value of the pound since the country’s Brexit vote in June pushes up the price of imported goods.

300,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Djalika wants to divorce her abusive husband. Her best friend Dior escaped a forced marriage and moved to the city, and her colleague Mareme is brazenly having fun with a married man. These are some of the characters in Senegal’s hit TV series “Mistress of a Married Man”, which has people talking about rape, domestic violence and women’s sexuality in a mostly Muslim West African country where such topics are taboo. The series offers a candid look at Senegalese society and has shocked audiences by showing what many women experience yet few discuss, said Halimatou Gadji, the 30-year-old actor who plays the show’s protagonist, Mareme Dial. Gadji grew up in Senegal’s capital, Dakar, and appeared in a few Senegalese series and short films before landing the role of Mareme, which has propelled her to fame. She hopes the show - a must-watch for millions of viewers - with its depiction of women as good, bad and complex will shake the rigid gender roles that restrain her generation. “All women would like to have the freedom of Mareme... to work, to wear what she wants, to talk about her sexuality,” Gadji told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. “Even if there are women who live like that, they don’t show it,” she said. Senegal, a democratic nation of about 16 million people with a growing, urban middle class, practices moderate Islam. Women are widely expected to remain chaste until marriage, move directly from their parents’ home to their husband’s and raise children. While Senegal ranks high in some areas of gender equality - it has one of the world’s highest proportions of women in parliament - women are oppressed in many walks of life. Domestic violence is widespread, women can be jailed for having an abortion and child marriage is common, experts say. Polygamy, explored in the series when Mareme’s lover eventually takes her as a second wife, is common. The show, which debuted in January and airs on Youtube as well as Senegalese television, has garnered complaints from religious groups, which accused it of promoting adultery. The country’s national broadcast regulator ruled in March that the series could continue but that it contained content that was “shocking, obscene and offensive”. Viewers have taken to Facebook and Twitter to discuss the show and side with either the wife or her mistress rival; a Facebook group called “Team Mareme” has 14,000 members. In one of the most controversial scenes, Mareme points below the belt before a date and tells her friend: “This is mine. I give it to whomever I want.” Her sexually liberated character was created partly to shock and pull in viewers, said Gadji, but the show’s main goal is to highlight the everyday struggles of other characters. “The series is not about Mareme, but we had to popularize Mareme to draw people’s attention toward the other women,” she said. Viewers say they identify most strongly with Djalika, a hard-working mother who suffers in silence under the tyranny of an abusive, alcoholic husband, said Gadji. Another character, Racky, was raped by a family member and internalizes the trauma rather than talk about it, a common scenario in Senegalese society, she said. “I have received a lot of messages from women who told me their stories and how they live at home, and wow,” said Gadji. “They suffer the same things.” Rape is legally defined as a delinquency in Senegal, and women’s rights advocates say men are rarely held accountable. The topics explored in the show feel personal to Gadji, too; she has an eight-year-old daughter but has never married and is wary of relinquishing her single lifestyle. “Senegalese men are not yet ready to accept women’s freedom,” she said. “I don’t want to be walked all over. I don’t want a man who will insult me and tell me to prepare his food.” She thinks change is coming slowly thanks to television, movies and social media, which show women standing up for themselves and playing multi-faceted roles. The show is watched by children - it does not contain sex scenes - and Gadji hopes young viewers might grow up with a more open mindset toward women’s independence. “We are showing them the bad so they can learn,” she said. “When I talk to children I am amazed. They have another vision.” Reporting by Nellie Peyton; edited by Lyndsay Griffiths; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and LGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate change.

301,"John Hicks, a standout offensive lineman at Ohio State University who became a first-round draft pick and rookie of the year for the Giants in 1974 but whose professional career rapidly fizzled, died on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. He was 65. The cause was complications from diabetes, said his wife, Cindy. Hicks, at 6 feet 2 inches and about 260 pounds, started for the Ohio State Buckeyes as a tackle under Woody Hayes in 1970 and became a critical part of the team. He went on to capture the kind of national attention rarely given to offensive linemen when the Buckeyes won Big Ten Conference championships in 1970, 1972 and 1973. Ohio State went to the Rose Bowl in each of those seasons and emerged victorious in 1974, against the University of Southern California, by a score of 42-21. A Hicks teammate in 1973, Archie Griffin, a running back who won the Heisman Trophy twice, told The Columbus Dispatch in 2001 that having Hicks on the line was reassuring. “I just had so much confidence running behind him because I knew that what was supposed to be there was going to be there,” Griffin said. Hicks was twice named an all-American and in 1973 won the Outland Trophy, for the best interior lineman in college football. That same year he finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting, behind Penn State running back John Cappelletti. It was a distinction unheard of for an offensive lineman. (Linemen Kurt Burris and Tom Brown had finished second in the Heisman voting in the past, but they had also played defense.) “John Hicks has never had a bad game,” Hayes, his coach, told The New York Times in 1973. “He’s the best football player on our team, and he’s the best interior lineman I’ve ever seen.” Hicks was drafted third over all by the Giants in 1974 and started at right guard that season, learning the finer points of pulling and pass blocking. “It’s a big difference changing from tackle to guard,” he told The Times. He was a rare bright spot during the Giants’ 1974 season, when they finished 2-12. He was voted United Press International’s National Football League rookie of the year. The honor turned out to be the high point of Hicks’s N.F.L. career. He spent three more dismal seasons with the Giants, who finished 5-9, 3-11 and 5-9, and in 1976 was accused of slacking by teammates speaking anonymously to the press. Things grew worse in 1977. That August, during training camp, Giants Coach John McVay told The Times, “I don’t think John thinks he’s playing to his potential.” Hicks disagreed, telling The Times, “I’m playing better than I ever have.” He started in only eight games that season, and that December he got into a barroom fistfight with a teammate, Jack Gregory, a scrap they both played down. Traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1978, Hicks did not play in a single regular-season or postseason game for them because of injuries. After the Steelers won the Super Bowl in January 1979, Hicks left the N.F.L. John Charles Hicks Jr. was born on March 21, 1951, in Cleveland. He played offense and defense at John Hay High School there before going to Ohio State, where he studied economics. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2001. After leaving the N.F.L., he ran a real estate development company. In 2004 he married Cindy Bredbeck, with whom he lived in Dublin, Ohio. He is also survived by a brother, Michael; a sister, Jacqueline Harris; three daughters, Alyssa Murfield, Alayna Hicks and Amarah Dawes; a son, Brandon; and four grandchildren."

303,"rise@ * India-Pakistan air corridor ""very critical"" - analyst * Several airlines cancel flights to Pakistan, India * Airlines flying over Indian-Pakistan air space rerouted * Tension escalates between India, Pakistan after air strikes (Adds comments from Singapore Airlines, British Airways, Air Canada and bullet points) NEW DELHI, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Several airlines, including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday after the South Asian nation closed its air space following heightened tensions with neighboring India. Etihad, flydubai, Gulf Air, SriLankan Airlines and Air Canada also suspended services to the country and flight tracking portals showed Singapore Airlines, British Airways and others were forced to reroute flights. Airlines flying over India and Pakistan to Europe, the Middle East and Asia were disrupted and some flights were routed through Mumbai on India's western coast, so they could head further south and avoid Pakistan air space, an Indian government official told Reuters. Pakistan carried out air strikes and shot down two Indian military jets on Wednesday, Pakistani officials said, a day after Indian warplanes struck inside Pakistan for the first time since a war in 1971, prompting leading powers to urge both of the nuclear-armed countries to show restraint. Tension has been elevated since a suicide car bombing by Pakistan-based militants in Indian-controlled Kashmir killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police on Feb. 14, but the risk of conflict rose dramatically on Tuesday when India launched an air strike on what it said was a militant training base. Mark Martin, founder and chief executive at Martin Consulting India, said about 800 flights a day use the India-Pakistan air corridor, making it ""very critical."" ""You can't overfly China, so you have to overfly Pakistan and India and go to Southeast Asia and Australia. Most of the traffic destined for Bangkok and Singapore will have to fly over Iran and then possibly take a detour,"" he said. International airlines that normally transit between Indian and Pakistani airspace have been forced to reroute, including flights by Singapore Airlines, Finnair, British Airways, Aeroflot, and Air India, according to online portal flightradar24.com which tracks the movement of planes globally. Qatar Airways said in a statement it has temporarily suspended flights to eight cities in India and Pakistan ""due to the ongoing situation on the India-Pakistan border"" and that its flights routed over the India-Pakistan air space may be delayed due to rerouting in the area. Bahrain's Gulf Air said it had suspended all fights to and from Pakistan due to closure of airspace while low-cost carrier flydubai said it is reviewing its schedule. Emirates and Etihad also said they had suspended some flights to Pakistan. All flights from Kabul to India have been canceled until further notice while India's state-run carrier Air India has canceled its flights until the first week of March, an airline official in Kabul said. Air Canada said it has temporarily suspended service to India because of Pakistan's airspace closure. Singapore Airlines' Europe-bound flights would need to make refueling stops, the airline said in a statement. British Airways said it is monitoring the situation closely. DOMESTIC DISRUPTION India, earlier on Wednesday, shut several airports in the northern part of the country temporarily, leading to dozens of domestic flight cancellations after Pakistani warplanes crossed a disputed border into the Indian side of Kashmir. Operations at the Indian airports have now resumed. Indian airlines including IndiGo, India's biggest airline by market share, low-cost rival GoAir and full-service carriers Jet Airways and Vistara, a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Tata Sons, were forced to cancel services to at least six cities in northern India due to airport closures. The airlines said on Twitter that flights to cities including Amritsar, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Jammu, Leh and Srinagar have been put on hold or temporarily suspended. Airports in the cities of Amritsar, Pathankot, Jammu, Leh and Chandigarh were temporarily closed for commercial flights earlier on Wednesday, sources told Reuters.

304,"Feature What the experiences of nonmonogamous couples can tell us about jealousy, love, desire and trust. Zaeli Kane and Joe Spurr.CreditCreditHolly Andres for The New York Times When Daniel and Elizabeth married in 1993, they found it was easy enough to choose a ring for her, but there were far fewer choices for him. Daniel, then a 27-year-old who worked in information technology, decided to design one himself, requesting that tiny stones be placed in a gold band, like planets orbiting in a solar system. He was happy with the ring, and what it represented, until it became obvious after the wedding that he was allergic to the nickel that was mixed in with the gold in the band. As if in revolt, his finger grew red and raw, beneath the circle of metal. He started to think of the ring as if it were radioactive, an object burning holes in his flesh. A month into the marriage, he took it off and never got around to replacing it. He and Elizabeth might not tell the story of that ring, with all its obvious metaphorical meaning, as readily as they do if Daniel were, in fact, ambivalent about marriage, so resentful of its boundaries that he found its most potent symbol too toxic to bear. But Daniel is a softhearted bear of a man, affectionate and affection-seeking, someone who entered marriage expecting, if not everlasting passion, at least an enduring physical connection. He was relieved to find, as the years passed, that he still loved his wife — they kissed hello each time they reunited, they made each other laugh and he was someone inclined to appreciate what he had. They had, by all appearances, a happy marriage. But as with any happy marriage, there were frustrations. Daniel liked sex, and not long after they were married, it became clear that Elizabeth’s interest in it had cooled. She thought hers was the normal response: She was raised by strict Catholics, she would tell Daniel, as if that explained it, and she never saw her own parents hold hands, much less kiss. It was not as if she and Daniel never had sex, but when they did, Daniel often felt lonely in his desire for something more — not necessarily exotic sex but sex in which both partners cared about it, and cared about each other, with one of those interests fueling the other. Elizabeth, baffled by Daniel’s disappointment, wondered: How great does sex have to be for a person to be happy? Daniel wondered: Don’t I have the right to care this much about sex, about intimacy? Occasionally, when he decided the answer was yes, and he felt some vital part of himself dwindling, Daniel would think about a radical possibility: opening up their marriage to other relationships. He would poke around on the internet and read about other couples’ arrangements. It was both an outlandish idea and, to him, a totally rational one. He eventually even wrote about it in 2009 for a friend who had a blog about sexuality. “As our culture becomes more accepting of choices outside the norm, nonmonogamy will expand as an acceptable choice, and the world will have to change as a result,” he predicted. He was in his late 30s when he decided to broach the subject with Elizabeth gingerly: Do you ever miss that energy you feel when you’re in love with someone for the first time? They had two children, and he pointed out that having the second did not detract from how much they loved the first one. “Love is additive,” he told her. “It is not finite.” He was not surprised when Elizabeth rejected the idea; he had mostly raised it as a way of communicating the urgency of his needs. Elizabeth did not resent him for bringing it up, but felt stuck: She was not even sure what, exactly, he wanted from her, or how she could give it. And so they continued on, volunteering at church, celebrating anniversaries, occasionally trying couples therapy and car-pooling their growing son and daughter; and they felt gratitude for those children and fondness for each other alongside bouts of stomach-gnawing dissatisfaction; Elizabeth picked up some work in project management she could do from home, and Daniel commuted, and they quibbled over whether it was time to mow the lawn. And then, one day in August 2013, when she was 44 and Daniel was 47, Elizabeth learned she had Parkinson’s disease. Elizabeth was still youthful, a student of yoga, a former dance-fitness instructor, her hair long and swingy. But there was a current sending a vibration through her left hand, as if her body was both announcing itself and telegraphing a message about its future. Exercise — which the doctor recommended, to slow the onset — became a mission, an act of defiance and a source of physical pleasure. She joined a hiking group, fighting off fear with new friends, new physicality. She wanted “to do life,” as she put it, and she wanted Daniel to do life with her. But after long weeks of work, Daniel was tired on weekends, maybe even more than usual, as he tried to come to terms with his wife’s diagnosis. One seismic shift in a marriage often drives another. In the fall of 2015, Elizabeth met a man at a Parkinson’s fund-raiser. Joseph had symptoms similar to Elizabeth’s and also felt he was in his prime. (Daniel, Elizabeth and Joseph requested that their middle names be used and did not want to be photographed to protect their and their children’s privacy.) He asked her to tea once, and then a second time. They understood something profound about each other but also barely knew each other, which allowed for a lightness between them, pure fun in the face of everything. They met once more, and that afternoon, in the parking lot, he kissed her beside his car, someone else’s mouth on hers for the first time in 24 years. It did not occur to her to resist. Hadn’t Daniel wanted an open marriage? Elizabeth did not announce that the friendship was turning romantic, but she did not deny it either, when Daniel, uneasy with the frequency of her visits with Joseph, confronted her. That she intended to keep seeing Joseph despite Daniel’s obvious distress shamed him: He was suddenly an outsider in his own marriage, scrambling for scraps of information and a sense of control. This was not at all what Daniel had in mind when he proposed opening the marriage. They had not agreed on anything ahead of time; they had not, as a couple, talked about their commitment to each other, about how they would manage and tend to each other’s feelings. “It wasn’t like we had a conversation about it,” Daniel said the first time I met him, in April 2016, when they were just starting to put that painful period of their relationship behind them. “It was more like: This is what I’m doing — deal with it.” We were at a restaurant near Elizabeth and Daniel’s suburban home in New England, a place where I met them several times over the course of a year, sometimes together and sometimes apart. Usually they sat close to each other, Daniel in a dress shirt he’d worn to the office, Elizabeth dressed like someone on vacation — a beaded bracelet, a sleeveless tank. Elizabeth has a Zen way about her, and as Daniel’s food grew cold while he relayed his past grievance, she looked untroubled. “It caused a lot of pain, so I’m still not even sure why I fought for it the way I did,” she finally said. “I really just felt like it was right, like it was important to my growth. It was like I was choosing to take a stand for my own pleasure and sticking to it. It was so strong, that feeling.” Elizabeth’s intransigence, and Daniel’s pain, had brought them back into couples therapy. After several months of surveying the situation, which seemed to be deadlocked, the therapist told them in early March 2016 that she thought they were most likely heading for divorce. It was the first time the word had been uttered aloud in that room. “It was like a fever broke,” Daniel said about Elizabeth’s reaction. She told him, that night, that she was ready to give up the relationship with Joseph if Daniel could not make peace with it. “She was suddenly able to talk about it calmly, and kindly,” Daniel said. “Suddenly my needs mattered again.” As soon as he felt that she cared about his well-being, he was able to consider what she wanted. “When I had no say in the matter, I was miserable,” Daniel said. “When I could say no, suddenly it was — O.K. This opening of our marriage started to seem less like something that was being done to me, and more like something we were doing together.” For several nights following that therapy session, they talked in their bedroom, with an attention they had not given each other in years, sitting on the strip of rug between the foot of their bed and the wall. The sex, too, was different, more varied, as if reflecting the inventing going on in their marriage. Elizabeth was still someone’s wife, still her children’s mother, but now she was also somebody’s girlfriend, desired and desiring; now her own marriage was also new to her. When I met Elizabeth and Daniel, Elizabeth had already received Daniel’s permission to keep seeing Joseph; Daniel was contemplating how he might, in turn, meet someone. Their marriage had already strained to accommodate another person, someone whom Elizabeth would meet while Daniel was at work, whom she texted in the car while her husband drove. They had to consider the possibility that the marriage’s resiliency might not withstand the challenges of adding another romance, another person. But Daniel said he was past the point of fear. “Basically you could say maybe we loved each other before all this — but maybe we were just asleep. And maybe being asleep is more dangerous and worse to you as a person than what’s going on right now. I want to be married, and I don’t want anything to happen to us. But I have no idea what would happen either way. Would you rather be asleep and have things fall apart? Or rather be alive and have things fall apart?” I met Elizabeth and Daniel through Tammy Nelson, a sex and couples therapist in New Haven and an old friend of theirs. She was not officially their therapist, although she had a particular interest in open relationships. In 2010, she wrote an article in Psychotherapy Networker, a professional publication, about the frequency with which she was encountering married couples whose ideas about fidelity were more lax than those she encountered at the outset of her career. She thought of the phenomenon as “the new monogamy,” which became the title of a book she published in 2012. “The new monogamy is, baldly speaking, the recognition that, for an increasing number of couples, marital attachment involves a more fluid idea of connection to the primary partner than is true of the ‘old monogamy,’ ” she wrote in the article. “Within the new notion of monogamy, each partner assumes that the other is, and will remain, the main attachment, but that outside attachments of one kind or another are allowed — as long as they don’t threaten the primary connection.” The spectrum of those attachments included one-night stands and ongoing relationships; as she understood it, honesty and transparency, rather than fidelity, were the guiding principles underlying the healthiest of these kinds of marriages. The couples did not perceive their desire to see other people as a symptom of dysfunction but rather as a fairly typical human need that they thought they were up to the challenge of navigating. Terms have long existed for arrangements similar to those she was seeing — they could fall under the category of polyamory, which involves more than one loving relationship, or the more all-encompassing term, consensual nonmonogamy, which also includes more casual sex outside of marriage or a relationship. (The use of each term implies full knowledge of all parties.) But most of the couples she was seeing did not feel the need to name what they were doing at all. “Most people don’t like the word ‘polyamorous,’ ” Nelson told me. “It’s not easy to say; it sounds a little French, with all respect to the French.” If pressed to find language, the couples might have said they were in open marriages, a phrase first popularized in 1972, with the publication of “Open Marriage: A New Life Style for Couples,” by Nena and George O’Neill. The book, which focused mostly on emotional openness, became a best seller, most likely because of a concept it introduced in three pages toward the end. “We are not recommending outside sex,” the authors wrote, “but we are not saying that it should be avoided, either.” The new monogamy is clearly not entirely new, although it may be an updated version of the old new monogamy, practiced by the ’70s-era suburban spouse-swappers depicted in Gay Talese’s “Thy Neighbor’s Wife,” published in 1980. The married couples Talese portrays are looking for meaning through sexual freedom, wreaking havoc in the wake of their quests. The book was published just as AIDS and Reagan-era conservatism were taking hold, and the next time open relationships would surface in a landmark book was in 1997, with “The Ethical Slut: A Guide to Infinite Sexual Possibilities,” written by a marriage and family therapist, Dossie Easton, and her co-author, Janet W. Hardy. Its title announced that the authors endorsed free love but believed it could be practiced with responsible care. In recent years, probably no one has made the idea of open marriage more accessible than Dan Savage, who coined the word “monogamish” to describe his own relationship status. Savage, an internationally syndicated, podcast-hosting and often-quoted voice on sexual ethics, is gay, married, a father and nonmonogamous. He has used his vast reach to defend consensual nonmonogamy, which Savage says is widely accepted in the male gay community as a choice that can foster a relationship’s longevity, provided all parties involved behave ethically. Some gay men believe that it is easier for them to enter those relationships than heterosexuals, because gay men have had no pre-existing model imposed on them. “I find it more impressive when straight couples are open,” said Logan Ford, 29, who is married and lives in New York. “Gay couples know from the beginning they have to create their own thing.” Technology also imports nonmonogamy into mainstream heterosexual dating life, making the concept more visible and transparent. On the popular dating site OkCupid, couples seeking other partners can link their profiles; users can filter their searches for people who label themselves “nonmonogamous.” The site, an intimate tool in the romantic lives of its users, renders no judgment, and therefore normalizes, institutionally, a practice few people had neutral language for in the past. Among 40-to-50-year-olds who identify themselves as nonmonogamous on OkCupid, 16 percent also announce that they are married, according to the site. Divorce, or not marrying in the first place, might seem like a more logical response to a desire for openness. But even as marriage rates have declined in this country, the institution has retained a seductive status for Americans. In his 2010 book, “The Marriage-Go-Round,” Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, argues that Americans, who are more religious than their counterparts in other wealthy, developed nations, are also more infatuated with marriage. And yet the tradition is nonetheless at odds, he argues, with the country’s emphasis on individualism, a tension that leads to high rates of divorce but also to remarriage, with worrisome outcomes for finances and children. Openness in a marriage, for better or for worse, would seem a natural outgrowth of those conflicting cultural values, especially since same-sex marriage, open adoptions, single-parent homes, and ideas about gender fluidity have already redefined what constitutes a family. Two-thirds of Americans feel that “a growing variety in the types of family arrangements that people live in” is “a good thing” or “makes no difference,” according to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center. And yet open marriages — and to a lesser degree open but nonmarital committed relationships — are still considered so taboo that many of the people I interviewed over the last year resisted giving their names, for fear of social disapprobation and of jeopardizing their jobs. It is no surprise that most conservatives would perceive the concept as a degradation of marriage, of a key foundation of society. But even among progressives I talked to, the subject typically provoked a curled lip or a slack jaw. The thought bubble, or expressed thought: How? How could any married person be comfortable with, or encouraging of, a spouse’s extramarital sex? The subject seemed offensive to many at some primal level, or at least ridiculously self-indulgent, as if those involved — working, married people, people with children — were indecently preoccupied with sexual adventure instead of channeling their energies toward, say, their children, or composting. Married for 14 years, I felt that same visceral resistance, an emotion so strong it made me curious to understand how others were wholly free of it, or managed to move past it. The divide between those who practiced open relationships and those who found the idea repugnant seemed inexplicably vast, given that members of those two groups often overlap in the same relatively privileged demographic (anyone holding down three jobs to keep a family together is not likely to spend excess emotional energy negotiating and acting on a nonmonogamy agreement). The more I spoke to people in open relationships, the more I wanted to know how they crossed a line into territory that seemed so thorny to their peers. I interviewed more than 50 members of open marriages, some of them a dozen or more times. I was drawn to the couples who were just starting out: What would the following months bring, what would they learn about themselves? I knew I wanted to follow the arc of their marriages, but I underestimated what, in so doing, I might learn about my own. In mid-March, about two weeks after Elizabeth and Daniel first agreed to think of their marriage as open, they drove toward a bar, where Elizabeth’s boyfriend, Joseph, was waiting for them. Tammy Nelson, their therapist friend, had long been telling Daniel he should meet the man Elizabeth was seeing. “Once you meet him, then you can decide how you feel,” she said. “Because right now, it’s just a story you’re telling yourself.” He was ready, and at Elizabeth’s urging, Joseph, too, had reluctantly agreed to meet. Riding in the car, Elizabeth fielded nervous texts from Joseph, who arrived before them. “I’m going home,” he texted her. “I don’t think I can do this.” Something about Joseph’s anxiety had a calming effect on Daniel. When Elizabeth and Daniel arrived at the bar, the men shook hands. Daniel felt the need to reassure him. “It’s O.K.,” Daniel told him. “We’re good.” He even felt a pang of empathy. Joseph was in a marriage that brought him little joy, but he was committed to it and had not told his wife about the relationship with Elizabeth, certain she wouldn’t accept it. Daniel, who is tall and dark, has mass to him, and strong features; Joseph has blue eyes and is more compact, a former high-school athlete who still, like Elizabeth, works out with discipline. Daniel’s ideal day entails relaxing around the house or hearing live music; Joseph relishes yardwork and is fastidious about his car. Daniel is a processor, a philosopher, a talker; Joseph is, as Elizabeth often says, “a simple guy.” Daniel assessed his wife’s boyfriend and decided with a defensive dismissiveness that he was “not a threat.” The conversation stayed light, the encounter ended without incident and then Daniel and Elizabeth went home and had sex: Reclamation sex, as it is sometimes called among the polyamorous. Daniel had started to think of episodes like this one as part of a new marital order he called Bizarro World. Bizarro World, Scene 1: His wife taking photographs of him to post on his OkCupid profile. Scene 2: He reaches under his pillow on a night when his wife is with her boyfriend and finds a note she has left, knowing his hand would slide precisely there. He opens it up to see a picture of a heart, with their names written inside, a plus sign between them. Scene 3: One night, close to bedtime, Daniel and Elizabeth explain the concept of polyamory to their two teenage children and tell them that although their mother is seeing someone, the marriage is still strong. Their son, who is 17, sounds almost proud of them for doing something so alternative. Their daughter, who is 15, takes it in more quietly, uncomfortably. She is just relieved, she tells them, that they are not fighting anymore. And it was true: They were not fighting anymore, not the way they had been in the first months of Elizabeth’s relationship. If anything, they were fighting harder for their own relationship, making more of an effort. Daniel finally started accompanying Elizabeth on those hikes; Elizabeth stopped putting up a fight when Daniel wanted to buy pricey concert tickets for them. And yet Daniel still felt conflicted about how the arrangement had started and all that it asked of him. In June, he sat down and made a document he called Bizarro World Benefits and Drawbacks. Under Drawbacks, the list he wrote, as if addressing Elizabeth, included: “You get distracted by your other relationship — emails, texts, etc. — and that can pull you from our moments. There is a third person in our relationship who is pervasively there and not there. The theory of nonmonogamy is easier than the practice.” Under Benefits, he wrote: “We are introspective about our relationship to make sure it stays solid. We are playing in the sexual energy often, and it feels really good. We are having a lot more fun together.” Elizabeth encouraged Daniel to invest more effort in meeting someone. She wanted the marriage to feel balanced, and she also wanted him to experience what she was feeling — that new relationship energy (for polyamorists, that is another technical term, frequently abbreviated as N.R.E.). Daniel took care creating his profile on OkCupid. (Asked to answer “What I’m doing with my life,” he wrote, “Laughing at everything, including myself.”) But he did not live in the kind of metropolitan area with a thriving polyamorous scene, and he did not find many women eager to date a married man. So it was several months after he posted his profile that Daniel went on a date with a woman he met on the site, someone who was also in an open marriage. They were still making awkward conversation at a bar when a woman sitting nearby asked how long they had been together. Daniel and his date exchanged glances; Daniel shrugged, as if to say: “Go ahead.” “He’s married to someone else,” his date said. “I’m married to someone else. We’re on our first date.” That broke the ice. Drinks flowed, and around midnight, Daniel found himself in a Ford Explorer, kissing a woman who was not his wife for the first time in 25 years. The option for more was obvious, but Daniel thanked his date for a lovely evening, said he’d be in touch and went home, feeling uncomfortable with both what had happened and what had not. It took a few days before he landed on the right metaphor for his experience. “You know that circus elephant who has the chain around its leg when it’s an infant, and it grows up and they take the chain off, but the elephant doesn’t know life without it — so it still doesn’t go anywhere anyway?” he said. “I noticed that the chain isn’t there, but I really don’t know what to do with that.” Mixed in with the fear of vulnerability that all dating entails was a sense of dread. He found it hard to believe that Elizabeth would not be jealous, and he worried, if she was, who would suffer more for it. Monogamy is an approach to relationships built on one bright-line rule: no sex with anyone else. Open relationships may sound like the more unfettered choice, but the first thing nonmonogamous couples often do is draw up a list of guidelines: rules about protection, about the number of days a week set aside for dates, about how much information to share. Some spouses do not want to know any details about the other spouse’s extramarital sex, while for others, those stories are a thrilling side benefit of the arrangement. These rules are often designed to manage jealousy. Most monogamous couples labor to avoid that emotion at all costs; but for the philosophically polyamorous, jealousy presents an opportunity to examine the insecurities that opening a relationships lays bare. Jealousy is not a primal impulse to be trusted because it feels so powerful; it is an emotion worth investigating. Popular evolutionary psychology holds that jealousy is innate, a biological imperative that evolved to guarantee watchful, possessive males some certainty of their offspring’s paternity. Polyamorists would argue, as would others, that humans are capable of overriding that system with rational discourse. But many of them reject that version of evolutionary biology altogether, citing the work of Chris Ryan and Cacilda Jethá, co-authors of “Sex at Dawn.” The book, which received mixed reviews from academics when it was published in 2011, argues that prehistoric humans lived communally, with a sharing, sexually promiscuous zeal most often seen in our primate relatives bonobos. Jealousy may be part of human nature, but social constructs amplify its power, with devastating costs. In her book, “What Love Is,” published this year, Carrie Jenkins, a professor of philosophy at the University of British Columbia who is married and has a longstanding boyfriend, questions the likelihood that humans, en masse, were built for any one mode of child rearing or sexual partnering, including, as she puts it, the “hippie commune” model that Ryan envisions. “We are definitely equipped with biological mechanisms that support collaboration and bonding and communication, and those have evolved to help us succeed in the difficult task of raising infants,” she said. “And anything that can threaten those bonds, that’s real pain, that’s real brain chemistry involved. But we are a diverse and adaptive species, so what we should predict is a suite of biological mechanisms that would allow diverse approaches to that challenge of raising children. Flexibility is what is distinctive about us as humans.” Susan Wenzel, a therapist in Winnipeg, Canada, whom I met through Tammy Nelson, did not open up her relationship with the man she was living with because she subscribed to any evolutionary theory. She did so because he had told her, gently, even fearfully, that he was concerned about the future of their relationship. He had been in love before, he explained, but those relationships had always ended with him growing restless, intrigued by another woman. Susan understood what he was seeking; she had patients she’d counseled while they opened their marriages. She felt equipped to manage the arrangement, and she and her boyfriend cautiously agreed that they could see other people, so long as those relationships remained casual. Susan did not feel it detracted from the strength of their relationship when she started seeing someone who is, like her, an immigrant from Kenya. But when that faded and her live-in boyfriend started dating someone, she found that jealousy hijacked the relationship. At the peak of one fury, she grabbed his phone and sent the girlfriend a text: “Get your own boyfriend.” “I was out of control,” she said. “And I didn’t like that. I wanted to understand my emotions.” She questioned her own volatility more than her boyfriend’s request, which seemed, to her, rational and honest. She sought therapy with Nelson, working by Skype to identify the source of her own jealousy. It was not the sex her boyfriend was having, she realized, that troubled her; it was the sense of scarcity — that she would not have enough of his time. Once that became evident, she was able to tell her boyfriend she needed to feel like a priority. She also had two young children from a previous marriage who lived with them, and she told him that she wanted him to take more responsibility for them, which he did. She eventually wrote her boyfriend’s female friend a note of apology, adding that she had resolved a lot of her own insecurities. The chief adjustment she and her boyfriend made was the one that seemed the least likely: They married, a year and a half after they first opened their relationship. Her boyfriend felt, for the first time, happy to commit to a woman he loved, knowing he had the freedom he wanted; and the symbolism of marriage gave Susan enough security that she could grant him that freedom, and exercise it herself. They saw no incongruity in their decision to wed — they were flexible, adaptable humans, reshaping an institution to their needs, rather than the other way around. In August, Elizabeth and Daniel made a road trip to a Lower East Side bar in New York to attend Poly Cocktails, a monthly event founded in 2007 for people who are interested in nonmonogamy, or practicing it. At the event, Elizabeth and Daniel felt overwhelmed, a little out of place. Over the course of the evening, about 300 people, a diverse crowd, packed into the rooftop bar, most of them, it seemed to Elizabeth and Daniel, younger than they were. A woman in cat’s-eye glasses and straight dark hair sat on another woman’s lap; the woman with glasses turned out to be one-half of a married heterosexual couple from Westchester. A 31-year-old man with his hair in a bun sat close to his beautiful girlfriend. Everyone seemed to know one veteran polyamorist: a 64-year-old man with a long, white braid. For the most part, the socializing was studiously nonsexual, but a young woman with a retro look — red lipstick, baby-doll dress — was flirting with a tall man in a sleeveless T-shirt, a 45-year-old dad from brownstone Brooklyn, a musician with a corporate day job. His wife looked on, amused, as she waited for a drink at the bar. Elizabeth and Daniel had ostensibly come to be among people who would not judge them. It had occurred to them that Daniel might meet someone, but he did not end up speaking to anyone to whom he felt a strong attraction. Instead he spent most of the evening talking to a married woman who complained that she felt underappreciated by the crowd at the bar. If Daniel was going to begin a relationship, he suspected it would be with someone he knew, and in the months following their outing to Poly Cocktails, he thought a lot about a woman from another state whom he met briefly through professional circles about two years before Elizabeth started seeing Joseph. The woman had subsequently sent him a succession of flirty texts. It had been a small, contained thrill to think of this woman, whom he had liked, reaching out to him, silently, on his phone, as he watched TV with his wife. It took him a while to notice that he had probably crossed a line without even realizing it, a series of harmless pixels coalescing into something that could hurt the feelings of people he actually knew and loved. The marriage was not yet open, and he told Elizabeth about the messages, relieved that it occurred to him to do so, and then — in one of the more intimate instant messages he had ever composed — told this person who had shown up in his life that they could only be friends, as much as he had enjoyed meeting her and was touched by the attention. Daniel and the woman would text from time to time, and when he heard she was coming to town this past January, he invited her to dinner. Over a meal, he told her that he and his wife had decided to open up their marriage, despite their enduring commitment to each other. He and the woman were already comfortable with each other, but once the possibility of romance hung in the air, the conversation immediately became deeper, as if they were preparing for one kind of vulnerability with another. Dating, I started to think, as Daniel told me about talking to his companion, is wasted on the young and the single. A young person in his 20s, unformed, skittish, goes out into the world and tries to fall in love, a project complicated by the bulky defenses that allow him to undertake so risky a venture in the first place. Now imagine that same person, many years into a stable marriage, anchored. He is no longer a stranger to himself; he is more likely to have forgiveness for human frailty. He can — theoretically — retreat to the safe harbor of his marriage at any time. What would it be like to be entranced by someone new, without needing, simultaneously to lay claim? At dinner, the woman told him about her past relationships, her worries about her children; he offered some advice and liked feeling that, although she heard him, she did not seem to need his help. She asked if he would mind if she moved her chair from across the table to sit beside him; she wanted to be closer. By doing so she brought the actual idea of sex right there, to the table where they were drinking margaritas: Was he attracted to her? Did he want to spend more time with her? After dinner they went back to her hotel. Elizabeth had been well aware that something might happen between them. “Are you naked yet?” she texted her husband around 10 — it was a joke, a poke, a bit of bravado. They were not. But by 11, his new romantic interest was. Later, when he thought back on the evening, he thought less about the sex than about the easiness that there was between them afterward. They had that conversation people often have after confirming a suspected mutual attraction with actual sexual intimacy — the “when did you know?” conversation, the one that shines a spotlight on your sense of being chosen. She wanted to talk about the first time they met, and how much she, right away, felt that spark. And Daniel found himself reminiscing about the first time he met Elizabeth, early in his career, and how she looked so strangely bathed in a bright light at that moment, as if the universe was trying to make something clear to him. “And we’re just having a normal chat, and I’m telling her how I feel about my wife, which in retrospect could have been really stupid,” Daniel told me. “But that I could share my love for my wife with her, and not have that takeaway from the experience, or even be awkward, even though she’s naked, lying on top of me — I really felt like it was kind of beautiful. And it struck me that she could have gone to this other place, and been insulted, ‘How dare you talk about that, you have me here now.’ But instead, she kind of saw it as a beautiful thing, too.” Conventional wisdom has it that men are more likely than women to crave, even need, variety in their sex lives. But of the 25 couples I encountered, a majority of the relationships were opened at the initiation of the women; only in six cases had it been the men. Even when the decision was mutual, the woman was usually the more sexually active outside the marriage. A suburban married man on OkCupid told me he had yet to date anyone, in contrast to his wife, whom he called “an intimacy vampire.” There was a woman in Portland whose husband had lost interest in sex with anyone, not just her. A 36-year-old woman in Seattle said she opened her marriage after she heard about the concept from another young mom at her book club. Perhaps the women in the couples I encountered were more willing to tell their stories because they did not fit into predictable unflattering stereotypes about the male sex drive. But it was nonetheless striking to hear so many wives risk so much on behalf of their sexual happiness. It took decades for sex researchers to consider the possibility that women’s fabled low libido might be a symptom of monogamy. An entire scientific field, well chronicled by Daniel Bergner (a contributing writer for the magazine) in his book “What Women Want,” has evolved to try to understand the near-total diminishment of lust for their partners that so many women in long-term monogamous relationships feel. One 2002 study found that men and women in committed relationships shared equal desire at the onset of their relationships, although for women, that desire dropped precipitously between one and four years into the relationship; for men, the desire remained high throughout that period. In his book, Bergner cites research suggesting that women desire novelty as much as men. The recent attempts to formulate medication to address waning sexual interest has been predicated on the assumption that one possible response — indulging an interest in newer partners — would never be practical and could be destabilizing. The women I met who initiated openness seemed to be defying some stereotypes about gender, but their interest was also consistent with more familiar ideas about women and intimacy: They seemed to be doubling down on building relationships in their lives. At Poly Cocktails, the wife who was watching her Brooklyn husband flirt said that although they had opened their marriage a few months earlier, she was the only one of the two of them who was seeing anyone: a wealthy entrepreneur, and a soccer player. “It’s an element of fantasy,” she said. “It’s play. And if it ever stopped being that, I would get out.” She was also a business owner, and had found, from the entrepreneur, a form of emotional support that her husband could not provide. Her husband told me he had little interest in putting in the work necessary for even casual flings. “If I could meet someone for sex once a week with no emotional obligation, like a regular tennis game, I would do it,” he said. “But I already wooed someone, my wife,” he said. “I don’t want to have to do that again.” The wife, who asked to go by her middle name, Ann, said she was friendly with couples whose marriages were open and ended badly. And yet neither she nor her husband, David (also a middle name), found those stories prohibitively ominous. Talking with me over several months, they explained, sometimes overtly, sometimes in more roundabout ways, that the instability they had invited into their lives worked as a counterbalance that allowed Ann to feel more secure within the marriage. Someone outside her marriage did the work of providing the structure of romance, dates, courtship; that heightened her own sense of sexuality in a way that David — who was consumed with his music, who was a creature of habit, who had thoroughly relaxed into the relationship — could not. Instead of resenting David for his distractions, demanding more focused attention from him, she seemed content to embrace the marriage for the security it did provide. The space between them that the open marriage introduced had, in fact, improved their sex life; but she also was more appreciative of the depth of the bond she felt with David, compared with the one she had with her boyfriend. “It’s been comforting to me,” she told me on the phone one evening this past March. She said she had to cut our conversation short — she was about to sit on the couch with David and watch a documentary. She laughed at herself a little, at the picture of her and David doing the thing that cozy but bored married couples do. “I’m wearing a onesie” — otherwise known as footed pajamas — she admitted. It was flannel, it was loose and it was very, very comfortable. For most of the late 20th century and early 21st century, therapists tended to champion monogamy with every bit of the consistency that religious institutions did. Many applied some form of adult attachment theory to their work, a theory that held, in its most simplified form, that if two people could create a secure attachment, if they could each patiently witness and soothe the other’s vulnerabilities, then love, growth and sexual fulfillment would follow. In 2002, the book “Can Love Last?” by the psychoanalyst Stephen Mitchell, complicated some of these concepts, positing that trust and comfort can also become hurdles in the way of sexual passion. “Since respectable monogamous commitment in our times tends to be reciprocal, the selection of only one partner for love dramatically increases one’s dependency on that partner, making more love more dangerous and efforts to guarantee that love even more compelling,” Mitchell wrote. “So we pretend to ourselves that we have, somehow, minimized our risks and guaranteed our safety — thus undermining the preconditions of desire, which requires robust imagination to breathe and thrive.” Mitchell valued committed relationships but thought it essential to acknowledge the ways that sexuality could collapse under the weight of the security that couples construct. Seven years ago, Luce Cousineau, a 47-year-old makeup artist in Seattle, had to admit that her own desire for her husband had dwindled past the point of recovery. She met her husband, Tim Aguero, who is 48 and a photographer, when they were in their early 20s. She never stopped loving him, wanting his opinion, considering him her best friend and the ideal father of their two children. But when she turned 40, she had a kind of midlife crisis that included a new, intense desire for more variety in their sex life. She and her husband could not find a way to talk about it — it was a series of endless missed connections. “And then I started shutting down in bed,” she said. They had sex less and less often. Her husband thought they could work through it. “Whereas I felt like it’s the end of the world,” Luce said. She finally realized that it was not just that she wanted varied sex; she wanted varied partners. “I felt like, I don’t want to be kinky with you — I want something different.” She developed an intense crush on a friend and lost hours thinking about him; she remembers sitting in her car in her driveway in Seattle, listening to an interview on NPR with Chris Ryan, an author of “Sex at Dawn,” and thinking his philosophy about the unnatural state of monogamy was speaking directly to her. “The standard issue would have been to have an affair, but neither of us wanted that,” she said. “I couldn’t imagine being excited about meeting someone and not being able to tell him.” But the lack of sex in her life, or sex that she wanted, was making her miserable. She finally broke down, sobbing, at the breakfast table one morning. They realized they were facing a serious issue. “I guess I felt like, We have to do something about this,” Tim said. “I was fearful, but I also had to consider her happiness.” Ending the marriage was never on the table, but Luce mentioned the idea of opening it up. They were two artists living in a big progressive city, with multiple polyamory meet-up groups, broken down by age. They agreed they would start dating, and they quickly found potential partners when they put their profiles up online. Forging new relationships was complicated, at first, and bruising: Could they go without a condom, if everyone tested clean and the relationship seemed to have potential? Could one spouse’s partner veto the other spouse’s new love interest, if that person had an S.T.D.? Tim, after a few false starts, started dating a married woman, a former minister, whose husband also had a serious ongoing partner. He is six years into the relationship with her now, and the four of them — Tim, his girlfriend, her husband and her husband’s girlfriend — sometimes have drinks. His girlfriend is important enough to him that most of his and Luce’s close friends and neighbors have met her and understand her role in their lives. Their children are 10 and 14; they have grown up knowing, as Tim put it, “that their parents are a little bit different.” There may be people who are more inclined toward monogamy or polyamory than others, who may even, at least one study shows, have some genetic predisposition toward one or the other. Tim seems to be a case study in adaptability, someone who never even considered, much less longed for, the option until his wife brought it up; he has since found the arrangement suits him. For the past three years, Luce has been seeing someone in Portland, a man with whom she says she is highly sexually compatible. The sex in her marriage, in recent years, she said, has improved, although she still sees it as a struggle within the committed, loving relationship she has been building since she was 21. “But don’t misunderstand — what Tim and I have is a joyous thing,” she said. “I’m so proud of the life we have built together.” Tim said that they’ve noticed that they have their best sex when they are on vacation — as if domesticity in their own home eviscerates the erotic. The insistent need for security stifles couples’ sexual excitement, Stephen Mitchell argued, but it also builds the relationship on false premises — the deluded idea that your partner is knowable and entirely safe. Clinging to that illusion, neither partner really sees the other, or even acknowledges that the other has hidden, private selves. Mitchell ended his book offering the hope that commitment, under the right circumstances, could yield romance and passion — not through contrived “novelty” but through an embrace of the risks inherent in building a shared life. Mitchell’s book, as well as “Mating in Captivity,” Esther Perel’s 2006 exploration of similar issues, suggests that the kind of marriage most people seek — secure, mutually desirous — is a precarious, elusive construct. Perel, whose forthcoming book is titled “The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity,” has become interested in the emotional growth that comes from having different partners. In the book, she writes that “so often the most intoxicating other that people discover in the affair is not a new partner; it’s a new self.” Some of the couples I followed as they forged their open marriages seemed to be reaching out, systematically but also unpredictably, to make transparent the vulnerability that was there all along. Implicit in the arrangement was the understanding that each person has an alternative self; and yet it was all in the name of the kind of committed relationship that Mitchell believed would yield the most happiness and personal growth. “You are the known way leading always to the unknown,” wrote Wendell Berry in a poem called “The Country of Marriage,” “and you are the known place to which the unknown is always leading me back.” As I talked to couples over the last year, I often found myself reflecting back on my own marriage. I started to feel less baffled by the boldness they were showing in opening up their marriages, and more questioning of my own total aversion to the possibility. In interview transcripts, I saw that I was forever apologizing for my own conventionality. I felt, at times, that I was a rusty caliper, trying to take the measurement of some kind of advanced nanotechnology. I was a blunt instrument, or a chipped mirror: Where I discerned motives of retaliation or evening of scores, I was told to see generosity and understanding. Where I read humiliation into a situation, the people I was interviewing saw a kind of expansive love that defied pride, possessiveness, traditional notions of masculinity and ownership. I kept wanting to define terms — but who is your primary? Whom would you choose in the event of conflicting needs? My instructors were patient but resolute in their overarching easygoingness: It works out, and when it does not, we talk about it and are better for it. Open marriages, I started to think, are not just for people who were more interested in sex, but also for people who were more interested in people, more willing to tolerate the inevitable unpacking conversations, the gentle making of amends, the late-night breakdowns and emotional work of recommitting to and delighting each other. Few claimed there was no pain in nonmonogamy; but they were not afraid of that pain, whereas the notion of any extra pain in my life seemed an impossible burden, a commitment along the lines of taking on a second part-time job or caring for an ailing parent. Occasionally, my reporting would inspire me to turn to my poor husband: Why don’t we work more on our marriage? But more often than not, I felt protective of what we had, more certain of its beauty, its cosseted security. I imagined our marriage transpiring within a genie’s bottle, all silk and luxurious hangings in a protective cocoon, a warm, private world in which transformation could occur; the nature of the surrounding boundary providing enough safety that we could feel confident in taking risks. Breaking out of that cocoon would be an act of needless destruction, its violence transforming the retreat into a hornet’s nest. But there was something about that idealized vision of the cocoon that seemed contrived; was it also cloying, or confining, or implicitly fragile? In February, Daniel planned a weekend away with the woman he saw the previous month — his girlfriend? His date? Neither word felt exactly right. He still felt concerned, both about how Elizabeth was going to feel about the weekend upon his return and about how he would feel in the midst of it. “I was nervous about how I was going to be received, and how I was going to handle it emotionally,” he said. Even the thought of being naked in front of someone new gave him pause. “There’s a little hesitancy — like, what is she going to think? But I think in the end when you’re with somebody who is compassionate and interested in you as a person, that all quickly just goes away — because, look, we’re all people, and we have our flaws and our good parts, and you either dwell on those things that aren’t perfect, or you see beyond it.” They ordered grilled cheese from room service and ate it on the couch as they talked about why they were there. They smiled at each other quietly as they sensed the attraction building. “And then we kissed, and honestly, it felt good,” Daniel said. “It just felt like, wow, I can be in this moment, and feel this other person kissing me, and me kissing them, and I feel I can do so in a way that is not violating my marriage and my commitment to my wife.” They had sex several times over the course of the weekend. Emailing about it, several months after the fact, Daniel wrote: “It was good, very good. ... As I write this, I am taken back to the moments there, and it does evoke a flood of stark imagery, emotion and sexual desire. ... There were no expectations or history to draw from. She was not afraid to express what she wanted, and in doing so, she challenged me to show up in ways that I don’t regularly — mainly in a more aggressive and dominant way. I guess what I’m saying is that it taught me some very valuable things about myself, or maybe invited some aspects of myself to come out.” Elizabeth claimed to have no ambivalence about his weekend away. She said she knew from experience that an outside relationship did not have to diminish your love for your spouse. And yet when Daniel returned, he found her a little bit cold, judgmental not about the premise of the weekend, she said, but about the particulars. She and Joseph had waited for months before having intercourse, building the relationship first; Daniel did not wait, which bothered Elizabeth. Also, Daniel had called her to say hello, which she had not expected, then jumped off the phone for a work call and failed to call back. That she did not like — the feeling that he had engaged her, almost deliberately, and then left her hanging, as if to force her to concentrate on him in his absence. As much as Daniel felt Elizabeth’s irritation, he felt a tremendous relief — her grievances were specific and manageable. She did not express the pain or anger or self-righteousness of someone who felt betrayed. Their understanding had made it possible for him to have that weekend away, for which he was enormously grateful. Over the weekend, he told his lover — at that point, there was really no other word for her — that he was committed to his marriage but not afraid to fall in love. She admitted she was already halfway there. Although they lived far from each other, they left with a sense of possibility, Daniel said, feeling “that there was more to come.” Many couples often start their open marriages with the idea that insomuch as an open marriage could be normal, theirs would be. For some people that meant that they would each have unattached sex but not do anything crazy, like fall in love with outside partners. For others, it meant that the spouses would never meet each other’s respective boyfriends and girlfriends, and certainly not those people’s partners. But some couples told me that once they opened their marriages, unexpected things happened. It was as if one major rethinking of convention subtly rewired their brains to allow for others. Antoinette Patterson, 34, and her husband, Kevin, 38, who live in Philadelphia, have been open practically since they met 15 years ago. Once she became a mother, she gave up on the idea that no partner of her husband’s could help parent their children. “By now my husband jokes that his girlfriend and I could raise our kids without him.” Many people I talked with said they were surprised that opening the marriage changed the nature of their sexuality, that something was unleashed: They developed a new interest in a certain kind of role play, or acted on a long-suppressed desire to sleep with someone of the same sex. “You have to be willing to spend more time deconstructing your inner internalized ick factor, when it comes to being open — your own self-judgment,” said Zaeli Kane, 35, a writer in Austin. Zaeli met her husband, Joe Spurr, when they were both 21, and they have been nonmonogamous for most of the time they have been together. When Zaeli and Joe married, they agreed to only one real limit on their openness: That they would not cohabitate with someone else. Nonmonogamy has been, since then, a defining feature of their life, a source of great pride, if for Zaeli, in some periods, an emotionally trying exercise. Her own past forays outside the marriage were short, brief affairs, more like adventures while traveling, discreet but romantic excursions; Joe, 36, by contrast had had deep, ongoing relationships, the details of which sometimes merely irritated Zaeli and at other times wounded her more deeply. “It took me years to realize that what feels like anger is sort of the pinched nerve of my admiration for another woman,” she said; she had often compared herself unfavorably with the other women Joe was seeing and worried she was not something enough: creative enough, say, or bold enough. “It’s a worthiness thing, or an impatience with myself to grow into the person I want to be,” she said. “But ultimately, I recognized that either I’m on the path I want to be on, or if I’m not, then that’s a good thing to notice.” Most recently Joe had started dating a traveling wedding photographer, Alexandra Kirkilis, to whom Zaeli was initially cautiously welcoming. Because she made no secret of the nature of her relationship, friends often called her to talk through the possibility of opening up their relationships. Then those friends started referring friends. Without really trying, she developed a small business, working as a kind of relationship coach to the newly polyamorous, among others. Both Joe and Zaeli agreed that she was happier in the marriage since she had developed her first meaningful relationship outside it. Two years ago, she was performing stand-up comedy when she met Blake Wilson, an aspiring comic himself who had relocated from Palo Alto, and they connected immediately: They shared a kind of hyperverbal, slightly dark, comedic sensibility; they were both thoughtful, but neither could ever be described as overly earnest. Blake started spending more time with Zaeli during the day, with Joe’s consent; Blake was working as a contractor and had a flexible schedule, which meant he could hold Zaeli’s hand through the long days that a young mother spends with a toddler, accompanying her to Costco, joining her at the park. Joe often came home to find them snuggling on the couch, at which point Blake would abruptly get up. Joe was comfortable with everything except the jumping up off the couch. “He really doesn’t need to do that,” he told his wife. “It makes me feel like the bad guy, or the cop.” Eventually, Blake and Joe, who comes from a tightknit Boston family, watched a few Patriots games together; he started to feel, toward Blake, the warmth you feel toward a brother-in-law who turns out to be more than tolerable — a relief mixed with genuine affection. And then, just over a year after Zaeli first met Blake, when Zaeli and Joe were planning to move to a new home in Austin, they discarded the one rule that had governed their nonmonogamy and invited Blake to move in with them and their daughter, who is now 3. For Zaeli, nonmonogamy was also an antidote to the atomization of families, to the loneliness of how people live. “People think of this as a home-wrecking. But this can be a nice family structure.” I thought that by the time I met Joe and Zaeli and Blake in February at their home in Austin that I had become used to the idea of openness. But from the moment I entered their house, I did not know where to look. Joe, warm and outgoing, greeted me at the door, making small talk I could barely engage in, as his wife and Blake were, at that moment, nuzzling by the stove, reunited after having been apart for most of the day. We sat down to dinner, Blake ushering their daughter — Joe and Zaeli’s daughter, biologically, but one Blake was helping to raise as part of the family — to the table. Blake does an equal share of day-to-day caregiving of Joe and Zaeli’s child, and Blake also does most of the cooking. That night, he made a Thai chicken soup for dinner. As we ate, Zaeli recalled first meeting Blake. “I could just tell with him, that it wasn’t just, this will be a guy that I hang with. It was more like, ‘Oh, I’ve found you,’ that whole thing.” Blake talked about how he felt when he met Zaeli. “It seemed a little bit safe, because I was like, ‘Oh, this person’s already married.’ And she just happened to be so caring and open and honest that we fell in love in like a month and a half.” I watched Joe take it all in, his daughter on his lap; he was playing with some tiny balls of Play-Doh that she had left on the table and was flattening them out, shaping them into one big heart. The conversation wore on, but I eventually admitted to them what they already knew, which was that this was all strange, maybe even hard, for me to witness — Blake kissing Zaeli in front of Joe, the two of them recalling how they fell in love. “I felt you checking in on me,” Joe explained. But there was no need, he said. He and Zaeli still shared a bed most nights of the week; they shared a daughter. She was his beautiful wife, and Blake was someone important to her. “It’s a person I love, loving someone,” he said. “How is love bad?” The generosity of his response almost made me angry, frustrated, perhaps, with my own limitations. Didn’t he feel excluded? “No,” he said. “I mean, I’m still here, you know?” This spring I went to a conference out of state. Afterward, a few attendees lingered to talk and then drifted off, with the exception of one, a man, also in his 40s, who spoke impressively earlier that day. The conversation was easy between us, and we ended up, as did everyone else, walking back to the hotel across the street, where I invited him to join me for dinner. I felt the need to justify this — there was no room service at the hotel, I felt awkward eating alone in the lobby — but I was also enjoying his company, and it seemed, especially after all the interviewing I had been doing, that it was absurd to worry about something as safe as a meal with a man, also married, with whom I shared professional interests. I was curious, even, to know what it would feel like — I realized that outside work interviews, I could not remember the last time I had dined alone with a man who was not my husband, which suddenly struck me as an amazing fact of my adult life. He looked uneasy at the outset, glancing around at the other people he knew in the lobby, nervous, I supposed, about what they would think. But he soon relaxed, and I was curious to hear who he was and why he did what he did, specifically, for work, and we probably tried hard to make each other laugh, and then we said good night and went our separate ways, an outcome that was never in doubt. Then I called my husband and told him, when he asked about my evening, that I had dined with a group of three or four conference attendees. Over the next day or two, I thought about the man, sometimes, and even wondered if he was thinking about me. Part of what I enjoyed in thinking about him, I realized, was that he was a private thought of my own, like a room in my house where neither my children nor my husband had ever so much as left an empty cereal bowl. Why had I lied? The triteness of the setup — a conference, a hotel — made me reflexively defensive; I was sparing my husband what would have been a wholly needless pang of jealousy or discomfort. And I was instinctively acting out a familiar, but also ridiculous, paradigm of marriage, one in which we collude in the fiction that no one of the opposite sex ever draws our interest. Maybe the impulse to lie also came from some other motivation: an insistence, in the moment, that I was not entirely knowable, or as safe as my husband thinks. And yet this seemed to be a signal he might even detect, if only subconsciously, precisely because we are so close. In a way, creating that space was in the spirit of openness, a tacit, healthy acknowledgment that we each have a private self, that no marital circuit is ever entirely closed. I wanted to keep my small secret; but I also wanted to go out to dinner with my husband, to hear what he would make of the minor intrigue, of my lie about a wholly harmless flirtation, if it even was that. And I wanted to hear how he felt about all the women in the world he will never really get to know, never get to kiss, a thought that makes me feel an existential sadness on his behalf. I was fairly certain I knew what he would say; but that I was not totally sure, that we had not discussed any of it for so long, seemed like an emotional infraction within our marriage, lazy and blinkered. There was so much to talk about. One year does not a marriage make; it is just long enough however, for couples to decide whether they have improved an already-strong marriage, or miraculously saved it from imminent demise, or recklessly endangered what was once a beautiful thing. Open marriages, like traditional marriages, fall apart for all kinds of reasons, but probably the most common one is that the marriage in question was troubled enough that no amount of tinkering with its parameters could save it. In April 2016, Jamie and Rich, a childless couple living in Pensacola, Fla., decided to open up their marriage. Jamie loved Rich, the way he had risen in the ranks at work despite never having attended college, the way he took care of their massive Bernese mountain dogs, took care of her. “He is everything to me,” she said one year ago. “I see myself growing old with him.” But she also had recently had affairs, and confessed them to Rich because she was fairly sure she wanted more: she wanted men she had never met, and that guy with whom she played online Scrabble, and to explore sex with women, and to have fun in a three-way. In early March, Jamie, 39, suggested that they consider separating, but Rich, 43, remembered that several years earlier, she brought up the idea of opening their marriage. He started looking for books on the subject, and he came to hope that the arrangement “was something we can grow with and explore and learn together.” And so it began. For Jamie, an endless series of dates; for Rich, one lost weekend with a woman he thought he could love. There were several nights of three-ways involving them both; relationships that flared then fizzled for each of them. Their own sex improved. And then, this April, one year after they opened their marriage, Rich asked for a divorce. The year had had its thrills, but Rich also felt perennially on guard, unnerved by the sense that there would always be more bruises to come. He had never really recovered from Jamie’s affairs, and he hated wondering, when he was home alone, what Jamie was doing with someone he had never met. He longed for the security of one partner, the beauty of its simplicity and romance. “I still love her,” he wrote about his soon-to-be ex-wife in an email. “I will support her.” She had offered to stop seeing other people, but he said he did not want her to feel resentful. “This is not the life for me, and just as important, I don’t want to stop her from being who she is.” Speaking a few days later after moving into a new apartment, Jamie said she was having more downs than ups; it was hard not to see Rich every day. But even as she mourned the end of the relationship, she could appreciate the generosity with which Rich had tried to please her, until the point at which he realized just how miserable he had become. And she also felt a surge of love for how strong he had been, in the end, to turn down her offer to stop seeing other people. “I hate to say it,” she said, “but I feel like he released me.” Their story is a kind of counterpoint to Daniel and Elizabeth’s, the couples’ marriage plots overlapping at crucial times but diverging at others. Daniel, too, after a year, also felt burdened by resentments, disappointed by how painful the path to a better relationship with his wife had been, and by how many logistical hurdles were in the way of a relationship with someone else. Neither he nor the woman to whom he felt so close had the finances or time to support a long-distance relationship. After a few months of sweet, sad instant-message exchanges, they agreed that they would not be able to see each other again any time soon — and that it might be less painful, especially for her, to break off the steady communication. Elizabeth was still seeing Joseph one year after she and Daniel opened their marriage. The fact that Joseph’s wife didn’t know troubles her, and she wrestled with guilt. But he had become someone she loved. Their relationship had permanence. When Daniel and Elizabeth fought, they no longer wondered if that might mean the end but knew instead they would work it out. Daniel had come to see Joseph as “part of my tribe.” He often helped Joseph out with computer problems; when he heard that Joseph had the flu, Daniel texted to see if there was anything he needed. Joseph agreed to speak to me only once. He was quiet and nervous and said little about how he felt about the arrangement. But he emailed Elizabeth with his thoughts the next day. “The reporter asked if I was jealous of Daniel,” he wrote. “Absolutely no. I know he is your husband, and I never want to stand in your way of loving him. It is obvious that he loves you unconditionally. However, I do want to express that I am jealous of one thing. He stands by your side through thick and thin. ... I realized you are one lucky girl. Never underestimate his love for you. Thinking back to the reporter’s question — yes, I am jealous. I’m jealous of the support he gives you and the freedom you desire. ... However, I am not jealous that you go home to him.” Instead of detracting from Elizabeth and Daniel’s marriage, Joseph sometimes served as a foil, a contrast against which Elizabeth could better see her husband — and not just her husband, but their history, the way he pulled over, without even asking, any time they drove by an ice-cream parlor, knowing it would delight her, or brought home a Diet Pepsi for her on his way back from work. And in starting something new with Joseph, she found she had refreshed her idea of what love could look like, which also infused her marriage. Daniel and Elizabeth had turned their union into an elaborate puzzle, one they could only solve together, had to solve together, for the well-being of their family, even if doing so demanded more from each of them than their marriage ever had. Energy for generosity in a marriage can easily suffocate beneath the accumulation of grievances and disappointments, or even laziness of habit; now both Elizabeth and Daniel felt the weight of those histories somehow shifting, if not entirely lifting. They had experienced enough to know that they could not predict how much their lives might change in another year or two; but they felt more confident that they could weather what was coming their way. “The marriage is better than it was when it started,” Daniel said in March. “It is. It really is.” He recalled something his wife said to him a few days earlier that had moved him. “Maybe it doesn’t sound that amazing, but we were just lying in bed talking, and she said, ‘What can I do to make you happy?’ ” An article on May 14 about open marriages described incorrectly a detail about child care in one marriage. Blake Wilson and Joe Spurr are equally involved in the day-to-day care of Spurr and Zaeli Kane’s child; Wilson does not do more of it. Opinion"
305,"Dust off your caldrons and crack open a set of quills because this fall two new books are sure to enamor Harry Potter fans with yet another dash of Hogwarts magic. But before anyone gets too excited, let’s make a few things clear: No, the two books coming on Oct. 20 are not new novels in J.K. Rowling’s spellbinding series. In fact, she’s not even technically the author of these archives. Instead, the two forthcoming works are aimed more at pleasing our inner Hermione Granger; “Harry Potter — A Journey Through the History of Magic” and “Harry Potter — A History of Magic” promise a “fascinating exploration of magical history” as written by the British Library’s “curatorial team,” according to the library shop’s website. “The ultimate gift for Harry Potter fans, curious minds, big imaginations, bibliophiles and readers around the world,” the website said of the books. The two editions are to be published by Bloomsbury (the British publisher of the “Harry Potter” books) and are being released as part of an exhibition at the British Library, which also opens on Oct. 20. That exhibition will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first book in the “Harry Potter” series, “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” (published as “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” in the United States). Reuters reported that Bloomsbury made an announcement about the library exhibition and the two books on Tuesday. An official at Scholastic, which publishes “Harry Potter” books in the United States, did not immediately reply to an email seeking additional comment about the latest texts. According to the British Library’s website, “Harry Potter — A History of Magic” is the “official book” of the library’s exhibition, and what officials called a “collaboration between Bloomsbury, J.K. Rowling and the brilliant curators of the British Library.” It pledges to mix the muggle world and the wizarding world amid 256 pages that will place “J.K. Rowling’s magical inventions alongside their cultural and historical forebears.” Potter nerds will be delighted to also find “exclusive manuscripts, sketches and illustrations from the Harry Potter archive,” the library said. The similarly named “Harry Potter — A Journey Through the History of Magic” also promises to be “packed with unseen sketches and manuscript pages from J.K. Rowling.” The description provided by the library says the book will take “readers on a journey through the Hogwarts curriculum, including Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy, Divination and more” and allow them to “discover the truth behind making the Philosopher’s Stone, create your very own potion and uncover the secret of invisible ink.” A statement on Ms. Rowling’s website, “Pottermore,” called “A History of Magic” an “adult edition” and its companion book, “a family edition for younger readers.” The books are the latest attempt to harness and sell the magic of Ms. Rowling’s world of wizardry without tampering with the seven core books that set off the global Harry Potter phenomena. The seventh and final book in the series was released in 2007. But in recent years Ms. Rowling has not been shy about revisiting the world she created. She gave her input to the playwright Jack Thorne, who wrote the play “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” which arrived on bookshelves in 2016. Scholastic said it sold more than two million hardcover copies of the play in the first 48 hours after it was released. It was billed as the eighth book in the “Harry Potter” series, and featured an adult Harry Potter living and working 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts. Ms. Rowling also wrote the screenplay for “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” a film that debuted later in 2016 and took place about 80 years before Harry was born. The film pulled in $75 million in ticket sales in North America over its first weekend. Ms. Rowling is not listed by the British Library as the author of the latest books, but the statement on her Pottermore website said that the works would be “published by Bloomsbury and Pottermore respectively.”"

307,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has raised the bar on oil contracts in Latin America after sweetening terms to attract international energy firms, luring $93 billion in future investment in the region’s first big auction this year. On Wednesday, Mexico awarded 19 of 29 deepwater blocks onoffer, comfortably more than the seven areas expected to be assigned. Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell emerged as the biggest winner, with nine blocks. Unique for generous terms such as setting a cap on royalties that oil firms can pledge to the government in bids, Mexico faces off this year with Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Uruguay. They will all hold auctions for oil and gas fields in 2018 that require billions of dollars in investment from foreign firms. Mexico is due to hold major auctions in March and July. While Brazil’s prolific deepwater presalt oilfields are expected to attract aggressive bidding from oil majors, other regional rivals could be forced to revise the terms of their auctions if Mexico scores another win in its next auction for shallow water areas in March, analysts said. Argentina and Ecuador have already changed their terms over the past year in preparation for their 2018 auctions. Argentina has lowered labor costs and some taxes, while Ecuador switched to production sharing from service contracts. Oil prices have reached three-year highs near $70 per barrel in 2018, giving the world’s top energy companies a cash boost and improving the chances that they will have the funds needed for big-ticket projects in Latin American. The industry is, however, emerging from a recession that cost tens of thousands of jobs and forced companies to slash spending on expensive projects such as those in deep waters. Oil majors have committed to keeping tight control on costs and will only bid for what they see as the most profitable projects. Oil executives and industry specialists say the terms on offer in Mexico, as well as the potential for major finds in the country’s deep water, made it attractive on Wednesday. At the auction, the decisive bidding parameter was the cash bonus that firms pledged. Shell won several bids with cash bonuses that drew surprised gasps from an audience mostly made up of executives from bidding firms and members of the media. Mexico collected $525 million in cash. While the government has limited its own take at the auction, the estimated $93 billion in investments pledged to develop the blocks auctioned is about 1.5 times greater than the amount involved in the previous eight auctions. After the government of Mexico started auctioning oilfields in 2015, it tweaked the terms of the bidding process several times, following a historic energy reform that ended state oil firm Pemex’s 75-year monopoly over the sector. The liberalization, the most ambitious plank of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s economic policy, started just as oil prices crashed in 2013-2014. The government had to balance the need for a big enough take for the state to placate opponents of the reform with ensuring there was enough potential profit to attract foreign firms. “Mexico understood how tough the competition for capital was in a very difficult oil price environment,” consultant Pablo Medina told Reuters. After failing to award a large number of blocks in previous auctions, the government regarded the results of this week’s deepwater bidding round as a success. As well as the limits on royalties, sweeteners included allowing foreign firms to propose areas to be included in the bidding rounds and relaxing the qualification process. Mexico also put a stop to “additional investment pledges.” This makes it harder for small companies to win by making unrealistic promises, but further limits the mandatory investment in projects. “What we are looking for is that the market tells us how big royalty should be and how much government take is possible to achieve,” Salvador Ugalde, head of the Mexican Finance Ministry’s Hydrocarbon Income Unit, said Wednesday. Brazil, which plans a busy auction schedule for 2018, does not expect Mexico’s auctions will lower interest in its own offerings, said Marcio Felix, Brazil’s oil and gas secretary. In Brazil’s last round in October, Shell and BP were the biggest winners. “We have a set of companies that have an appetite for a certain type of asset,” Felix told Reuters on Thursday.

308,"While most people are catching on to the appeal of 529 plans, which offer tax-advantaged investments to pay for qualified education expenses, many still overlook a number of benefits these accounts provide. ""This is the best way to save for a child or grandchild's education, period, end of sentence, "" said Young Boozer, chairman of the College Savings Plans Network and state treasurer of Alabama. As the cost of higher education continues to skyrocket, 529 plans can be a lifeline for parents and grandparents. ""Many people don't realize how much flexibility a 529 plan gives them or the advantages it offers beyond the tax-deferred growth of the investments,"" said Steven Brett, president of Marcum Financial Services. According to Brett, here are the top reasons a 529 college savings account is increasingly worthwhile. You can get a tax deduction or credit for contributions to a 529 in many states, earnings grow on a tax-advantaged basis and, when you withdraw the money, it is tax-free if the funds are used for qualified education expenses. What counts as a qualified education expense is extensive; 529 plans can be used for undergraduate or graduate school, technical or trade schools, even cooking schools or golf schools in the U.S. and some accredited schools abroad. You can also use them to pay for room and board, fees, books, computers or other supplies. You are not limited to your home state's plan, which means you can choose any state's 529 — after factoring in fees and the performance of the investments. However, you may only be eligible for a tax deduction if you choose the plan offered in your state. ""You have to weigh that against the amount of fees and investment options in the long run,"" said Brett. There is no limit on the number of 529 plans you can hold at one time. That means if you've already picked a plan in your state, it's not too late to find a plan that suits you better. You can open multiple accounts in multiple states without ever having to combine or consolidate them. These plans offer a variety of investments, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and fund of fund portfolios. Most plans offer risk-based or age-based options, similar to target-date funds in a 401(k). Anyone can make a contribution (although state laws vary on whether you can get a tax break). ""We encourage people to let their friends and family know they can make a contribution,"" said Boozer. ""It's a great gift and you don't have to worry about the color, size or fit."" While there are state-set limits on how much you can contribute in total to a 529 plan, the threshold is high.In many cases, you can make contributions until the balance reaches close to $400,000. These contributions also qualify for a gift-tax exclusion. And there are no income restrictions as there are with other types of savings accounts. Furthermore, five years' worth of gifting — up to $70,000 for an individual or $140,000 per couple — can be front-loaded and saved for a beneficiary tax-free, provided there is no other gift given in the same time frame. The big advantage here is that you reap the benefits of compounding. ""Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world, "" said Boozer. It's not a ""use it or lose it"" account — 529 owners can change their beneficiaries at their own discretion and without limitation. For example, if one child doesn't use all or any of the funds in the 529, then the account can be put in the name of a sibling or other family member. These accounts never expire, so those assets can even be passed down to other generations, from child to grandchild to great-grandchild. In the fortuitous case that your child gets a full ride or receives a partial scholarship, the amount equal to the scholarship can be withdrawn without penalty. However, you may owe taxes on it."
309,"(Repeats a item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Graphic on Paris climate agreement: tmsnrt.rs/2fTjA1w By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 2 (Reuters) - It’s not hard to imagine Chinese President Xi Jinping having a wry smile at both the decision by Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord and the global reaction. While President Trump’s decision had been expected, it does confirm that world leadership on efforts to limit global climate change will now shift to Asia, and China in particular. Xi is now free to accept the mantle of global leadership on climate action, which will give him an opportunity to advance China’s interests across the world at a time when Trump’s actions are likely to cost the United States influence and allies. The best part for Xi is that this hasn’t cost him anything, Trump has done the damage to the United States all by himself, and is most likely unaware or uncaring of the likely consequences, which go well beyond the blow to the image of the United States as a global leader. It’s been a good past few weeks for Xi, given the successful hosting of a regional summit in Beijing to promote the “belt and road” initiative that ended on May 15 with pledges by China to spend as much as $800 billion on projects aimed at boosting trade and development across Asia, Africa and into Europe. China, the world’s largest polluter, was also quick to state that it remained committed to the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees centigrade by the end of the century. “China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change,” Premier Li Keqiang told reporters on Thursday after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel and before flying on to Brussels for meetings with European Union officials that will include how to keep the Paris agreement going without U.S. participation. While China has moved quickly to step into the leadership role vacated by Trump, it’s likely that Xi will be looking for more than just increased prestige and prominence in international affairs. China will most likely be seeking to attract more investment into renewable energy technology and manufacturing, building up a sector of its economy that is already experiencing rapid growth. The opportunities for China are immense, as it can step into the U.S. role of providing technology and equipment transfer to developing nations to help them meet their commitments under the Paris agreement. China has committed to plough 2.5 trillion yuan ($361 billion) into renewable power generation by 2020, as the world’s largest energy market continues to shift away from dirty coal power towards cleaner fuels. The investment will create over 13 million jobs in the sector, the National Energy Administration said on Jan. 5 in a document that lays out its plan to develop the nation’s energy sector during the five-year 2016 to 2020 period. No doubt China will also seek to export renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines, and this process may well be helped by the country’s strong stance in favour of the global climate accord. It’s also likely that China will join European countries in rejecting Trump’s efforts to negotiate a better deal. The countries that remain committed to the 195-nation Paris agreement have little incentive to give a better deal to the United States, the world’s second-biggest polluter. Rather it’s more likely that they may seek to impose carbon-related tariffs on U.S. goods if these are deemed to be enjoying an unfair advantage because they are produced in an economy free of carbon restraints. It’s difficult to see how Trump’s decision to exit the Paris deal is anything other than an own goal. It’s highly improbable that this will lead to more manufacturing jobs in the United States, instead it may actually encourage renewable energy pioneers to look at establishing facilities in countries with more progressive views. It’s also unlikely to revive the U.S. coal industry, which will remain under pressure from cheaper natural gas and the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewables. It’s a massive blow to U.S. prestige, and one that will likely filter down to U.S. companies that do business globally, making it harder for them to win business. It also shows that Trump has little regard for his country’s international reputation and that he remains under the spell of climate change deniers and nationalists with limited grasp of science or the economic implications. Trump’s actions also fly in the face of the wishes of many U.S. companies, including those that are supposed to be beneficiaries of the withdrawal, such as Exxon Mobil. The maelstrom of criticism Trump is getting for abandoning the global climate pact is unlikely to dissuade him, or convince the section of his support base that fervently believe it is the correct course of action. Much like the British vote to leave the European Union, the true costs of Trump’s decision will only become apparent once it is too late. (Editing by Richard Pullin)"
310,"In a world shifting to the cloud, Microsoft has carved out a place trying to help companies caught between two worlds — on-prem legacy solutions and the public and private cloud. To help further that hybrid mission, the company announced it was acquiring Avere Systems today for an undisclosed amount. Microsoft describes Avere as “a leading provider of high-performance NFS and SMB file-based storage for Linux and Windows clients running in cloud, hybrid and on-premises environments.” That’s a mouthful, but essentially the company has focused on maximizing storage performance, especially in more expensive flash storage, regardless of where you store your files. Avere’s president and CEO Ronald Bianchini Jr., wrote in a company blog post that the company has worked hard since its inception to provide highly efficient file storage solutions. “Our customers efficiently share both storage and compute resources across multiple data centers, and effectively implement and use private and public cloud infrastructures,” Bianchini wrote. That is precisely a focus of Microsoft’s cloud strategy, so it appears to be an excellent fit. In a blog post announcing the acquisition, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for Microsoft Azure, Jason Zander, described Avere’s approach. “Avere uses an innovative combination of file system and caching technologies to support the performance requirements for customers who run large-scale compute workloads.” This could be particularly useful for high-performance media customers like Sony Pictures Imageworks, animation studio Illumination Mac Guff and Moving Picture Company (MPC). But it doesn’t stop there. Zander wrote that the Avere technology could also be useful in life sciences, education, oil and gas, financial services and manufacturing or anywhere companies could benefit from more efficient use of high performance storage and compute resources. Microsoft expects the deal to be finalized in the coming months subject to the customary approval process in these kinds of deals. The company has indicated that the Avere team will be coming on board as part of the deal and they will retain their Pittsburgh offices. As Avere becomes part of the Microsoft Azure family, it’s unclear what impact it will have on existing customers, but there is always some adjustment when a company gets acquired in this fashion. Avere was founded in 2008 and has raised $86 million with its most recent investment, a $14 million Series E coming last year in March. Investors in the E round included Google and Western Digital, but it was Microsoft who comes away with the prize. Previous investors included Lightspeed Ventures, Tenaya Capital, Menlo Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners."
311,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese services sector activity rose in January due to a pick-up in domestic demand, a business survey showed on Tuesday, but there are growing worries that economic activity will weaken due to the U.S.-Sino trade war. The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 51.6 in January from 51.0 in December. The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 28th month. “Business activity grew at a stronger rate, supported by stronger demand and continued growth of employment,” said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. The improvement in the services sector is likely to be overshadowed by a survey last week showing manufacturing activity skidded to a 29-month low as exports tumbled due to the trade war. The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 50.9 in January from 52.0 in December because of the deterioration in the manufacturing sector. Another risk to Japan’s domestic demand is the government’s plan to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October. The government will offer temporary tax breaks and subsidies to soften the blow to consumption, but some economists are worried that households will still curb spending after taxes rise. Japan’s household sentiment is sensitive to changes in the global economic outlook, because many manufacturers export machinery and electronic parts to companies in China. This means consumer spending could also weaken if the trade war between the United States and China drags on without resolution. Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Kim Coghill"

318,"Italy's parliament is convening for a vote on Friday that could pave the way for negotiations between rival parties to form a coalition government. But, as ever with Italian politics, there are plenty of obstacles to overcome. The vote is aimed at electing speakers to both the upper and lower houses of parliament, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies respectively. Italy's most popular single party — the Five Star Movement (M5S) — and the most popular coalition of center-right parties, including Lega and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, have discussed the possibility of each appointing a speaker of their choosing to one of the houses, although there are already disputes over this. ""The situation is evolving now and I hope that in the end an agreement will be found because it's absolutely necessary to move ahead... with negotiations for a new government,"" Franco Frattini, former foreign minister and president of the Italian Society for International Organization (SIOI) told CNBC on Thursday. The current political stalemate follows an election on March 4 that led to a hung parliament, with no one party or coalition winning a majority of seats allowing it to govern alone. The vote saw anti-establishment, populist parties like M5S and Lega do much better than expected, while traditional, long-standing ones, like the former ruling Democratic Party and Forza Italia, performed badly. Once speakers to both houses of parliament are elected, hopefully Friday, negotiations can begin to form a government — but that process will likely also to be protracted and could take weeks, if not more. The process will be overseen by Italian President Sergio Mattarella. Frattini, who was foreign minister in two former cabinets under Berlusconi, was not worried about the formation of a coalition government. ""We're in very good hands with President Mattarella and I'm sure he'll be able to get this difficult situation under control... Stability is possible, provided that Mattarella promotes a good agreement (between the parties) based on tax reduction and cutting useless public spending where there is broad agreement,"" he said. The largest win for a single party was claimed by M5S, with 32 percent of the vote, but the center-right coalition including Lega and Forza Italia was the largest coalition, with 37 percent. Neither M5S nor the center-right bloc gained enough votes to govern alone, however. The former ruling Democratic Party fared badly in comparison, with 23 percent of the vote. On Wednesday, the center-right coalition — which is made up of Lega (formerly Lega Nord), Forza Italia, the right-wing Fratelli d'Italia, and the smaller Noi con l'Italia — claimed the right to name the upper house speaker and said M5S should name the speaker in the lower house. So far, M5S has opposed the center-right's choice of Paolo Romani for speaker of the upper house, however, meaning Friday's vote is far from clear cut. Still, Italy is no stranger to political stalemates and M5S and Lega have shown some willingness to at least talk about forming a government, although there are major differences over key policies. For instance, M5S wants a universal basic income, which guarantees a minimum set of earnings for all, while the center-right coalition wants a flat income tax of 15 percent. There are also frictions between political leaders, with M5S' Luigi Di Maio clashing repeatedly with Forza Italia's Silvio Berlusconi. So personalities are also likely to prove a sticking point. In addition, old rivalries are at play. While the Democratic Party performed badly in the election, it nonetheless could have a decisive factor in the formation of a government, playing something of the role of ""kingmaker,"" either choosing to support or oppose a proposed coalition government. It has previously shown an aversion to an anti-establishment M5S-led government, although the party is divided, with some members favoring a coalition. Against this backdrop, political analysts did not expect the election of speakers Friday to provide any clarity on overcoming the deadlock created by the election. ""A possible deal over the speaker positions between the two populist forces that prevailed on March 4 — the Five Star Movement and the Northern League (Lega) – should not be regarded as a prelude to a possible joint governing arrangement,"" Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of Teneo Intelligence, said Tuesday. The lack of visibility on a future government ""is likely to persist for weeks and the outcome of the consultations that will start later this month remains highly uncertain,"" he added. ""Regardless, the election of the two speakers will constitute a first significant test for the cohesion of the center-right electoral bloc and the unity of the extremely-divided Partito Democratico (Democratic Party). This is important, given the fact that the arduous task of creating a working majority could be facilitated by eventual defections and a party split."" The Italian Minister of State for EU Affairs, Sandro Gozi, told CNBC Thursday that growth is back for the country and there is also a consistent fall in unemployment. However, the Democratic Party politician said the wealth was, once again, not being spread around the country. ""The north is full steam ahead, at Germany standards, but the south is once again being excluded,"" he said. Gozi said that his Democratic Party had fared poorly in elections because it had not managed to shake a perception that refugees from the Middle East and North Africa were flooding into Italy. And on the proposed new coalition, Gozi said he hoped Italy would continue to have a strong role at the European level. Used to political instability in Italy, markets remain sanguine about the lack of government. After all, Germany has itself only just formed a coalition government after months of political stalemate. Italy's FTSE MIB has recovered from the sharp decline seen after the election result and is now trading higher than the days leading up to the election, despite the success of populist parties that could upset Italy's relationship with the rest of Europe. Richard McGuire, Lyn Graham-Taylor and Matt Cairns, from Rabobank's global economics and markets research team, said in a note Wednesday: ""Overall, the picture remains unclear as we remain in the very early stages of political negotiations. ""However, the market appears to be happy to trade 'no news is good news' while 'focusing on positive signs of any political developments that there are... rather than the negatives... while this lack of clarity remains."" - CNBC's Willem Marx contributed reporting to this story."
319," (CNN)Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner has denied clemency for a Chicago veteran who is facing deportation after serving two tours in Afghanistan with the US Army, CNN affiliate WLS reported.  ""It's not appropriate to go into detail on reason for a decision, but we take every review of clemency and pardon very seriously,"" Rauner told WLS. ""We made the decision not to grant it in that case."" Miguel Perez Jr., 39, has been detained at an US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Kenosha, Wisconsin, since last year. ICE began deportation proceedings while Perez was serving a sentence for a felony drug charge. He lost his green card and became a target for immigration authorities due to his conviction and a pardon could have helped him remain in the country.  Perez's attorney has been fighting his deportation in court. He appealed the deportation order, but a three-judge panel of the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his plea last week. He could be deported this month. Perez is not the first veteran of the US military to face deportation. An estimated 3,000 veterans have been deported in recent years, according to a report by the Texas Civil Rights Project. 'I saw many horrible things' Perez was born in Mexico and came to the United States at age 8 when his father, Miguel Perez Sr., a semi-pro soccer player, moved the family to Chicago because of a job offer, Perez told CNN in an interview. He served in Afghanistan from October 2002 to April 2003 and May 2003 to October 2003, said his lawyer  Chris Bergin. He added that Perez left the Army in 2004 with a general discharge after he was caught smoking marijuana on base. After leaving the Army, Perez's life went off the tracks. He attributed these problems to post-traumatic stress disorder, which was not immediately diagnosed. ""I saw many horrible things, things I can only, until this day, speak about with a mental health specialist and even then after I say them, the nightmares start up again,"" he said. ""They are things that happened to me personally, that happened to others, and to Afghans themselves -- 12-, 11-year-old kids split in half by 50-caliber bullets at our hands. He became addicted to drugs, drank heavily and the legal problems began.  In 2010, Perez was convicted on charges related to his delivery of more than 2 pounds of cocaine to an undercover officer. He was sentenced to 15 years on a charge of manufacture or delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance, ICE spokesperson Nicole Alberico said. As he served half his sentence in prison, he was able to get the treatment he needed for his PTSD and finished his associate's degree.

The maker of Sam Adams said that Dave Burwick would succeed Martin Roper as president and CEO. The company said that Burwick would start the job by June. Jim Koch will continue in his role as company founder and chairman. Burwick is no stranger to Boston Beer; he has served on the company's board of directors since 2005. In late 2012, Burwick was named president and CEO of Peet's Coffee, which is owned by JAB Holding, the privately held German conglomerate that also owns Panera, Krispy Kreme and Keurig.

323," (CNN)Losing a child is more than most parents can bear. But having to explain the loss to your grandchildren can be just as heartbreaking. ""They cry to each other,"" Diann Aldridge told CNN's Rachel Crane after her daughter Nykea Aldridge was killed Friday in gang-related crossfire in Chicago while pushing her baby in a stroller. The baby was unharmed, but Nykea's four children will grow up without a mother. ""It just hurts to hear kids saying they want their mom and their mom won't be in their lives anymore,"" the grandmother told Crane on Sunday, fighting back tears. ""Only through spirit, only through pictures -- that's the only way they will know their mom for the rest of their lives."" Nykea Aldridge, a cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade, died less than an hour after sustaining a pair of gunshot wounds, the result of two paroled brothers with gang ties opening fire in the street. Her death refocused attention on Chicago's epidemic of deadly gun violence and even became an issue in the presidential campaign when GOP nominee Donald Trump referenced it on Twitter. But for Diann Aldridge, it brings unimaginable personal sorrow. ""It's just heartbreaking. It's really -- oh, God, it's heartbreaking,"" she told Crane. Her daughter's three older children are 12, 10 and 8.  ""They tell each other, you know, they miss their mom. They want their mom."" Wade, a 12-time All-Star guard who recently left the Miami Heat to sign with his hometown Chicago Bulls, mourned his cousin's passing on Twitter. Police have charged Darwin Sorrells Jr., 26, and Derren Sorrells, 22, with first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. Somehow, Aldridge finds mercy for her daughter's killers. ""I truly, truly from the bottom of my heart, I forgive them. I forgive them,"" she said. ""I can't bring her back, but I forgive them."" "

326,"(Reuters) - United Airlines UAL.N on Wednesday said its third-quarter net income fell slightly less than investors had feared as the third-largest U.S. carrier was hit by $185 million in pre-tax losses caused by canceled flights during the Atlantic hurricane season. Looking forward, it forecast a pre-tax margin of between 3 percent and 5 percent for the current quarter, a steep drop from 9.8 percent a year ago, largely due to an increasingly competitive fare war in key markets against low-cost carriers Spirit Airlines Inc SAVE.O, Frontier Airlines and others. United has acknowledged the short-term impact on profit from matching sharply discounted fares against its competitors, but has said it would continue matching until it could outpace low-cost rivals. United’s shares hovered around the unchanged mark in after-hours trading. The Chicago-based airline said passenger revenue per available seat mile, a closely watched measurement of an airline’s performance, fell 3.7 percent, about 1 percentage point of which was attributable to disruptions caused by storms. For the current quarter, United forecast that passenger revenue per available seat mile would decline by 1 percent to 3 percent. It reported net income of $637 million, down 34 percent from $965 million in the year-ago quarter. Excluding some special charges, United reported earnings per share of $2.22 per share. That beat Wall Street’s average forecast of $2.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Reporting by Alana Wise; Editing by Bill Rigby"

Former Obama-era counterintelligence official Nate Synder warned Tuesday that the Trump administration should not take any short-cuts on its approach to Huawei. Republican strategist Marissa Martinez predicted Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden will win the Democratic nomination, citing his fundraising prowess. A senior adviser to Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden’s greatest vulnerability is his “pro-corporate policies.” A senior adviser to Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign said Monday that the Vermont senator and progressive rival Sen.

330,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities are investigating whether a suspected militant arrested last week was plotting an attack on the resort island of Bali, police said. Bali, a popular tourist destination, saw a number of attacks by homegrown militants in the early 2000s, the deadliest being a nightclub bombing that killed 202 people, mostly Australians. Police found a bomb and “high (impact) explosive materials” during a raid on the suspect’s house on the western island of Sumatra, media said. The man, whom police have yet to identify, was arrested on suspicion of having links with extremist group Islamic State and of being involved in planning a suicide bombing at a police station in the central Javanese city of Solo last month. The Solo attack only killed the bomber himself and wounded one police official. Edy Hartono, chief of the counter-terrorism police unit, said police were looking into the suspected Bali plot. “It was still just a plan,” he told Reuters, declining to elaborate. The arrest in Lampung, Sumatra, was among a series of terrorism-related arrests across several cities in Indonesia last week as authorities intensify a security crackdown in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country. Indonesia saw its first Islamic State-linked attack in January when four militants mounted a gun and bomb attack in a busy commercial district in the capital Jakarta.

331,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Three investor groups called on Monday for a new, independent investigation into Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) emissions test-rigging scandal, saying the inquiries launched by the German carmaker so far may not be far-reaching or transparent enough. German investors’ association DSW and Deminor, a Brussels-based firm which represents investors including the city of New York pension fund, said shareholders should be allowed to vote on launching such an investigation at Volkswagen’s (VW) annual general meeting (AGM) on June 22. London-based Hermes EOS also called for an independent inquiry into the “potential liability of the members of the management and supervisory boards” of the German company. VW declined to comment. In September, Europe’s largest carmaker admitted it had cheated diesel emissions tests in the United States. It has created a Special Committee on Diesel Engines headed by Wolfgang Porsche, head of the family clan that controls VW, to investigate the scandal and hired law firm Jones Day to find those responsible. But DSW said that wasn’t enough. “When you have an independent investigation you can be sure that the findings will be publicized. With internal investigations you do not know whether everything has been made transparent,” spokesman Juergen Kurz said. Deminor said VW’s internal probe was only looking for “serious and manifest breaches” by the management, which de facto reduced the review of board members’ liability. DSW mostly represents retail investors. Deminor declined to put a figure on the proportion of VW shareholders it represents. Hermes EOS advises investors with about 170 billion pounds ($246 billion) in assets, but says its clients account for just 0.013 percent of voting shares at VW. Hermes EOS also urged VW investors not to ratify the actions of the management board at the AGM. Under German corporate governance rules, shareholders are asked to do this, though in VW’s case the vote is likely to pass comfortably given the majority stake of the Piech-Porsche families. VW has so far declined to comment in detail about the initial findings of its probe. But it has said there were no indications to date that current management was involved in the scandal. The company, which has set aside 16.2 billion euros ($18.2 billion) to cover vehicle refits and legal costs, has also said it is reorganizing the processes and structures used for approving the software for engine control units with more clearly defined and binding responsibilities. DSW acknowledged the chances of forcing an independent investigation were slim, given the Piech-Porsche families jointly control 52 percent of VW voting rights and are unlikely to back the proposal. If that happens, DSW could try to win a court order to enforce an independent investigation, DSW’s Kurz said. Reporting by Edward Taylor additional reporting by Jan Schwartz; Editing by Mark Potter"

333,"Several commodity markets may have experienced sharp turbulence in the first three months of 2016; yet one precious metal seems to have weathered the storm almost effortlessly. Gold has seen its biggest three-month gain since the third quarter of 1990, showing gains of more than 15 percent so far this year. And if it continues its winning streak, gold could be heading for its best quarter in close to 30 years, according to Reuters. One strategist however believes that there's still more room to run for the yellow metal. ""There's still a lot more upside scope to go as the long-term chart shows on gold with an eight-year cycle bottom in place,"" Ron William, senior tactical & market timing strategist at The ECU Group, told CNBC Thursday. ""Certainly there's a big change in investors psychology now in the yellow metal as seen by the performance. And by the models we're following, it is the best outperformer across multi-assets this year."" Gold prices have been boosted in recent months thanks to global market sell-offs, geopolitics and concerns over leading economies being potential reasons why prices are heading higher. On the week, gold is currently up over 1 percent, buoyed by Fed Chair Janet Yellen's call for caution over U.S. interest rate rises and a weaker U.S. dollar being some of the more recent drivers. In the short term however, William told CNBC it was likely gold would see ""further unwinding"" in the short-term, before prices made their next big move to the upside. While January and February saw a continued sharp rally in the metal, prices in March haven't shown the same level of gains, as global markets recover from the year's initial volatility. ""Since January past, gold has been outperforming equities — S&P in particular — which is likely to continue. At the moment, equities are still in their rally phase but as a short-term phase that we are expecting to (see in) early April into the Q2 period,"" William added. ""However, we think that will then resume lower for a big potential fall in equities and then gold (will see an) outperformance over the long-term."" William added that there was a lot more uncertainty for investors to hedge with when it comes to gold, noting how markets have yet to face two significant events: the EU referendum in June and the U.S. presidential race coming to its climax in November. When giving specifics, William said he expected to see a potential pickup in gold during the summer period, which would continue through towards 2017. ""Looking for a move above $1,288 for the March high, into then $1,488 or $1,500. So there's still some upside scope to go."" —By CNBC's Alexandra Gibbs, follow her and"

335,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron, campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union, has the edge over London Mayor Boris Johnson, the most popular figure in the “Out” camp, in trying to sway the key group of undecided voters, a new poll indicated. Evidence on which camp was ahead from another poll taken after Cameron’s deal on new EU membership terms for Britain struck on Feb. 19 showed both sides were neck and neck. The ruling Conservative Party is deeply split on the EU issue to be decided in a June 23 referendum, with Cameron and Johnson the figureheads of the opposing camps vying in particular for the support of moderate Conservatives, regarded as the pivotal, swing group of voters. Overall, the latest ComRes telephone poll for the Daily Mail found that the “In” camp was ahead by 12 points at 51 percent, though its lead had narrowed since details emerged of Cameron’s deal with the other 27 EU heads of government in Brussels. An online YouGov poll for the Times found the sides were neck and neck, reflecting a trend that has been apparent for several months whereby phone polls have found “In” far ahead while online polls have found much closer results. The YouGov poll, which had the “Out” camp one point ahead at 38 percent, suggested a drop in support for the “Brexit” option, which had been ahead by nine points in a poll published on Feb. 5, before Cameron’s deal was finalised. ComRes interviewed 1,000 people between Friday and Monday, while the YouGov poll of 3,482 people was conducted between Sunday and Tuesday. Both straddled key news developments. Cameron clinched his EU agreement late on Friday night and announced on Saturday that the official government position was to campaign for an “In” vote. Britain has been in the EU since 1973 and has its second largest economy. Six members of his cabinet defected to the “Out” side on Friday and Saturday, while on Sunday Johnson, who is not in the cabinet but has far greater popular appeal than those who are, came out for Brexit in a blaze of publicity. ComRes analyst Adam Ludlow said Johnson was important because of his appeal to moderate Conservatives. Half (52 percent) of Conservative voters say they may change their mind, more than enough to change the June 23 outcome, ComRes says. Its poll found two thirds of Conservative voters (68 percent) had a favorable opinion of Johnson, while 88 percent viewed Cameron favorably. “Johnson can carry a message and moderate Conservative voters will consider it rather than dismiss it out of hand,” Ludlow wrote. “His affableness may also soften the perceived threat of leaving the EU for some less committed ‘remain’ supporters.” “There is of course one towering figure respected more than any other by moderate Conservatives, whose endorsement for remaining in the EU is more important than any other: David Cameron.” The divergence between the online and phone polls, coming after all pollsters got last year’s general election wrong, has raised uncertainties in a context where Brexit fears have knocked the sterling currency to a seven-year low. JP Morgan said in a research note that it was inclined to put a little more weight on the soundings done by phone. “They may be less susceptible to biases arising from attracting highly politically engaged voters, and they also tend to have around half as many undecided people — potentially offering a little more clarity about which side of the fence the swing voters are coming down on.” But YouGov’s Anthony Wells and Stephan Shakespeare argued that in person-to-person phone interviews people felt pressured to give an opinion even if they didn’t hold it that firmly, and were more likely to say they favored the status quo. They maintained that the phone polls may be over-stating the “remain” vote as a result. The British Social Attitudes Survey, a face-to-face survey using a random sampling method believed to give the most accurate results, found in its most recent research that 60 percent wanted to stay in the EU while 30 percent wanted to leave.

336,"“My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.” Not since President Reagan’s off mic quip has the American chattering class worked itself into such a lather about the Russian menace. Unfortunately, while the interminable discussion over Moscow’s “election hacking” continues, The Big Three — Iran, China, and North Korea — continue to assault our cyber flank, driven by a force as committed to malice as the Gipper was to a good laugh.    Moscow is not our sole cyber adversary, and, when you strip away the shirtless bravado, you see the Russia of today is not the Main Enemy of yesteryear. Think about it: Its economy is smaller than a sputtering Italy, its infrastructure is fracturing at the seams, the public is tiring of the kleptocrats, internal unrest is rife, and the military, despite Syrian bluster, is largely decaying.  Were it not for its aging nuclear arsenal, they would fall somewhere between Brazil and Canada on the threat matrix. While giving the Bear it’s due attention, it is time to keep calm, course correct and address the cyber threat posed by Iran, North Korea and China. Moscow hysteria aside, let’s examine Iran. Tehran has long been considered a cyber backwater — less advanced, and technologically and intellectually inferior to other adversaries such as China and Russia. This is a dangerous misconception. Iran’s cyber army is young, adroit and their attacks are complex, aggressive and strategic. Iran has poured billions of dollars into creating offensive cyber capabilities which could potentially paralyze America’s government and military operations. Further, we must not overlook how vigorously Iran has battered U.S., Saudi and British infrastructure. They have besieged the financial sector and permeated and pillaged our ivy walls of academia. Last year, in an attack characterized as, ""a frightening new frontier of cybercrime,” they targeted a dam in upstate New York. Capitalizing on the boundary-less possibilities of cyperspace, Iranian hackers continue to target energy, telecommunications, and chemical companies and, in an ultimate gesture of appreciation, even the United Nations. In recent years, Iran has stolen more than 31 terabytes of data and intellectual property according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The data was purloined to “assist Iranian universities, as well as scientific and research organizations, and to obtain access to non-Iranian scientific resources,” according to the DOJ statement. In short, Iran now has technological know-how and capabilities that would have taken years and billions of dollars to develop indigenously. Congress and the U.S. government must take the Iranian cyber threat seriously and act accordingly. Grandstanding about Russian election hacking on cable news should give way to a deliberate, clandestine program aimed at recalibrating the global cyber battlefield. Cyber conflict is new, but the first step is timeless: recognize and comprehend your adversary’s end game. To this end, the Mullah’s have been quite clear they are driven to consolidate power and build regional authority. For Iran, the cyber battlefield is significantly more egalitarian and cost-effective than tanks, planes, boots, and halal MREs. Cyber warfare allows Iran to erase America’s overwhelming conventional military lead, so it’s a reliable bet Tehran will continue to strive and invest to improve its cyber capabilities. Iran is waging an enduring, targeted crusade of malicious cyber warfare against the United States, our allies, and any other country which questions (and, thus, threatens) the Iranian leadership’s raison d’etre. Blinded by our pinpoint focus on the Russian cyber program, the Mullah’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are continuing to drive, develop, and wield a formidable cyberwar complex — funded in part by President Obama’s $1.7 billion cash donation. Unfortunately for us and our partners, the “cyber arms race” will unquestionably prove more difficult to contain, monitor and combat than the rogue nation’s nuclear program.

337,"(Adds comments, details; updates prices) March 12 (Reuters) - European stock index futures plunged to their lowest since mid-2016 on Thursday as investors were rattled by dramatic travel restrictions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in an attempt to halt the fast-spreading coronavirus. Trump on Wednesday suspended travel from Europe to the United States for 30 days, responding to mounting pressure to take action against the outbreak, which the World Health Organisation now classifies as a pandemic. Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 6.3%, after earlier plummeting as much as 8.3%. FTSE futures gave up 5.6%, while German DAX futures tumbled 6%. ""It appears we are getting to the next stage of the crisis, moving from self-isolation and regional isolation to almost national isolation,"" said Matthew Sherwood, head of global investment strategy at fund manager Perpetual in Sydney. ""That's obviously terrible for the transport sector and there is much broader ramification because it seems the only way to halt the advance of the virus is by virtually shutting down major parts of the economy to the detriment of growth."" The European travel and leisure sector has fallen more than 18% this month as containment measures crushed passenger numbers, forcing airlines to cancel flights en masse. With global growth expectations already taking a hit from the worldwide spread of the virus, investors have fled risky equities to the perceived safety of gold and bonds, bringing Wall Street to the brink of a bear market. All eyes will now be on the European Central Bank policy meeting later in the day, with expectations running high of the central bank joining its British, American and Australian peers in cutting interest rates further.

338,"Let's be clear: ""U.F.O."" is an acronym for ""unidentified flying object."" It doesn't necessarily mean aliens. But it also might mean aliens. Sorry, Miriam. A Saturday report in the New York Times lays out the details of a secret, Defense Department-funded ""Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program,"" formed to investigate UFO reports.  Among the more sensational details is the revelation that a number of buildings in Las Vegas were modified to house ""metal alloys and other materials ... from unidentified aerial phenomena."" It's a seemingly minor detail in a much larger story about a program that was established in 2007 under the guidance of then-Senate majority leader Harry Reid. The Nevada Democrat turned an interest in space phenomena into a DoD-funded $22 million investigation. Reid confirmed the existence of the program, as did Pentagon officials, though the latter claim that the program ended in 2012.  ""It was determined that there were other, higher priority issues that merited funding, and it was in the best interest of the DoD to make a change,"" Pentagon spokesperson Thomas Crosson told the Times.  Still, the Pentagon's engagement here is a big surprise: This is one of the few times — if not the first — that an arm of the U.S. government confirmed the existence of a modern program designed to look into extraterrestrial events. The Las Vegas storage location(s) were constructed by Robert Bigelow, a friend of Reid's and a NASA contractor who is currently working with the aerospace and aeronautics research agency on human habitats for outer space. The Times writes: Under Mr. Bigelow’s direction, the company modified buildings in Las Vegas for the storage of metal alloys and other materials that Mr. Elizondo and program contractors said had been recovered from unidentified aerial phenomena. Researchers also studied people who said they had experienced physical effects from encounters with the objects and examined them for any physiological changes. In addition, researchers spoke to military service members who had reported sightings of strange aircraft.  Although the Pentagon confirms that funding for the program came to an end in 2012, former military intelligence official and program administrator Luis Elizondo claims that research efforts continue. The Times unearthed a great deal more information about this program and its beginnings, supporters, and operations. Definitely give that story a look if you're interested in learning more.

340,"(Reuters) - National Anti-Doping Organisations (NADO) applauded the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on Thursday for getting access to Russian laboratory data but warned that it should not yet be doing a “victory lap”. WADA said last week that after much feet dragging by Russian authorities, it had extracted doping data from a discredited Moscow laboratory, a condition of its controversial decision in September to restore the accreditation of Russia’s anti-doping agency (RUSADA). “While WADA is to be commended for obtaining the data, and RUSADA congratulated for its willing cooperation, it is not cause for celebration,” said NADO in a statement. “It is not yet appropriate to turn the page on the issues, nor should the principals at WADA be doing a ‘victory lap’, rather it is the opening of another chapter in the tragic saga of a state-sponsored doping scheme.” WADA said on Tuesday it would not reimpose a suspension on RUSADA despite Moscow missing a Dec. 31 deadline to hand over the laboratory data. The data collected from the tainted lab will be examined for any sign of tampering, while Russian authorities must ensure that any re-analysis of samples required by WADA is completed — in an accredited laboratory — by June 30. NADO noted that Russia continues to bid to host international events, such as the 2024 Youth Olympics, which would not be possible if evidence of tampering is found and RUSADA is again declared non-compliant. “Although WADA and the IOC (International Olympic Committee) would have us believe this is now all behind us, diligence requires otherwise,” said NADO. NADO called for renewed vigilance and compensation, including the recovery from Russia of all costs incurred relating to the doping crisis since RUSADA was suspended in 2015 after a WADA-commissioned report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russian athletics. NADO is also calling for an exhaustive, independent expert review of the authenticity and integrity of all the data retrieved followed by another independent review of the crisis to identify any lessons to prevent a recurrence. “Throughout the entire ordeal, NADO leaders have signaled our steadfast commitment to the global athlete community in support of clean sport,” said NADO in a statement supported by the National Anti-Doping Organisations of Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and U.S. “Much painstaking work remains before any page can be turned on the greatest doping scandal of all time.” Editing by Toby Davis"

342,"D-backs blow lead before edging Braves in 11 PHOENIX — Brandon Drury did not hit the longest of sacrifice flies, but his line drive to short left field was all the Arizona Diamondbacks needed for their second walk-off victory in three games. Atlanta left fielder Matt Kemp made a diving catch on Drury’s liner with one out and the bases loaded in the 11th inning, but he could not right himself and get enough on the throw before Jake Lamb scored the winning run in the Diamondbacks’ 10-9 victory over the Braves on Wednesday at Chase Field. “I thought it was going to drop off the bat, but he was playing so far in that he got it,” Drury said. “He made a pretty good play and got to it. It is just tough to come up and throw a guy out from there after you dive.” Paul Goldschmidt, Jean Segura and Lamb homered for Arizona, and Zack Greinke recorded his 2,000th career strikeout in a game that featured 14 pitchers and 32 hits and lasted four hours, 46 minutes. Arizona led 3-0, 6-2 and 9-4. “Eventually we got it done,” Arizona manager Chip Hale said. Lamb doubled with one out in the 11th inning off Jose Ramirez (2-1) and took third on a wild pitch before Chris Owings was hit by a pitch and Mitch Haniger was intentionally walked. That brought up Drury, who had his second walk-off plate appearance of the season. “Couldn’t get up in time to make the throw,” Kemp said. “He hit it in the right spot. I guess I wasn’t in far enough. I was already in. There’s really not much you can do right there. It happens so fast.” Goldschmidt and Lamb each had three hits and two RBIs, and Welington Castillo had three RBIs. Goldschmidt hit a walk-off homer in the ninth inning Monday in the Diamondbacks’ 9-8 victory over the Braves. Michael Bourn, released late in the spring by Atlanta, had four hits including two triples, and scored three runs for the Diamondbacks (53-74). Ender Inciarte had four hits and two RBIs, while Markakis and Flowers each had three hits and two RBIs for Atlanta (46-81). The Braves fell for the 11th time in 14 games. Atlanta tied the game at 9 with four runs in the ninth inning. Adonis Garcia homered to open the inning off Enrique Burgos, who walked the next two batters before Markakis hit an RBI single to make it 9-7. Flowers greeted Dominic Leone with an RBI double before pinch hitter Anthony Recker walked to load the bases. Chase d’Arnaud’s sacrifice fly tied it. “We had a legit chance to win against one of the better pitchers in baseball, and it’s a tough one to lose,” Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. With a stolen base in the third inning, Goldschmidt has 20 homers and 20 stolen bases, the third first baseman since 1974 to have back-to-back 20/20 years. Jeff Bagwell and Ryan Klesko also did it. Segura tied his career high with his 12th homer in the fifth inning, and Lamb’s two-run homer later in the inning was his 25th. Greinke gave up four runs and six hits in six innings while becoming the 78th pitcher to strike out 2,000. He struck out five and walked three. Greinke is the eighth active pitcher to reach 2,000 strikeouts, reaching the milestone when Freddie Freeman swung over a 2-2 slider leading off the fourth inning. “It was a good pitch. I stopped making good pitches after that one pretty much,” said Greinke, who was touched for two runs in the fifth and two more in the sixth. Greinke made his first home start since June 13 after missing five weeks with a strained oblique muscle. Patrick Corbin (5-13) threw two scoreless innings for the win. It was his first home victory this season. Atlanta right-hander Julio Teheran gave up six runs and 11 hits in six innings. He entered the game ranked eighth in the NL with a 2.90 ERA, but he saw that figure jump to 3.15. NOTES: Arizona OF Yasmany Tomas (mid-back stiffness) did not play Wednesday after being removed in the eighth inning of the Tuesday game because of the injury. ... RHP Matt Wisler will be recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett to start for Atlanta on Thursday at Arizona. Wisler was 4-11 with a 5.16 ERA in 21 appearances (20 starts) with Atlanta before being optioned to the minors the first week of August. He was 2-1 with a 3.71 ERA in four starts there. ... LHP Robbie Ray (7-11, 4.31 ERA) will start for the Diamondbacks on Thursday. ... Arizona RHP Shelby Miller is scheduled to start for Triple-A Reno on Thursday and is “on the verge of coming back,” manager Chip Hale said. Miller is 5-1 with a 3.52 ERA in seven starts since being optioned to Reno after the All-Star break. ... Atlanta SS Dansby Swanson was given his second start off since being promoted to the majors Aug. 17. Swanson is hitting .280 with a double, an RBI and three multiple-hit games in his first seven contests (six starts) after striking out as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning Wednesday."

345,"South Korea on Friday said North Korea has doubled its cyberattacks targeting the South over the past month. During a parliamentary committee meeting, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) told lawmakers that its neighbor had unsuccessfully tried to infiltrate the country’s railway control system, as well as numerous financial institutions, The Associated Press reported. The intelligence agency also fleshed out recent reports that North Korea was trying to crack into South Korean government websites and smartphones. Officials said Pyongyang had targeted 300 smartphones belonging to foreign affairs, security and military personnel. Hackers successfully infiltrated 40 of these phones, pilfering text messages, voicemails and phone logs, according to the office of a South Korean lawmaker. The intelligence agency did not tell lawmakers whether any of the data stolen was sensitive material. The escalating North Korean cyber campaign comes amid heightened tensions between the two neighbors. Pyongyang on Monday threatened to launch a preemptive nuclear strike on South Korea and the U.S. in response to joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises taking place this week. The efforts also fit an emerging pattern for North Korea, in which Pyongyang ties cyber campaigns to moments of blustery rhetoric and military drills. In January, shortly after Pyongyang officials claimed to have conducted a successful hydrogen bomb test, Seoul said it believed North Korea had launched a spate of cyberattacks on southern targets. Reportedly the digital assaults planted malware on a number of government networks. U.S. lawmakers recently approved a bill that slaps sanctions on North Korea for its burgeoning cyber capabilities and resurgent nuclear program. “This is the first time we’ve ever had mandatory sanctions on cyberattacks,” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who backed the legislation, told The Hill last month. “It’s long overdue.” “This will be a model for what we do as other bad actors try to attack the United States through cyber means,” added Gardner, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity.

346,"President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE made history on Sunday by becoming the first sitting U.S. president to cross into North Korea, a symbolic gesture toward Kim Jong UnKim Jong UnPompeo expresses concern over North Korea missile tests State Dept. extends travel ban to North Korea Can we do business with Kim Jong Un? Leadership analysis might give clues MORE during a meeting at the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in which the two leaders agreed to restart stalled nuclear talks. Trump and Kim afterward spoke privately for more than 50 minutes, turning what was supposed to be a brief exchange of pleasantries into a negotiating session in which Trump said they both agreed to “designate a team” and “work out some details” in his on-again, off-again effort to end Pyongyang’s nuclear program. “Speed is not the object. We want to see if we can do a really comprehensive, good deal,” Trump told reporters. “This was a great day. This was a very legendary, very historic day.” “It’ll be even more historic if something comes up, something very important,” the president added. Trump’s meeting with Kim was his first since nuclear talks broke down at a February summit in Hanoi, Vietnam. Major doubts still surround the negotiations and Kim’s willingness to surrender his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. But Trump was determined to show the public he can secure a nuclear deal with North Korea, which would be his biggest achievement on the world stage. It came days after he agreed at the Group of 20 summit to reopen trade talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, pressing to secure another elusive deal and show voters he can be the dealmaker in chief ahead of his 2020 reelection race. The history-making moment came at 3:45 p.m. Korea time, when Trump and Kim shook hands across a concrete slab that forms the line separating the North and South. At Kim’s request, Trump stepped over the line, and the two men walked back toward a plaza in the North, where they posed for photos. “Good to see you again,” Kim said to Trump, according to a translator. “I never expected to see you in this place.” “Good progress. Good progress,” Trump said as he and Kim crossed back into South Korea. “Stepping across that line was a great honor,” Trump said, adding that he would invite Kim to visit the White House. The image-conscious Trump framed the gesture as a rebuttal to critics who say he will not be able to secure a deal with Kim. “You don’t report it accurately, but that’s OK. Some day, history will record it accurately,” he said. Trump and Kim met at the Freedom House on the South Korean side of the DMZ, where the North Korean leader said he was “willing to put an end to the unfortunate past.” Kim said he was “surprised” when Trump made the invitation by tweet on Saturday but hailed the importance of the meeting as a sign of the “excellent relations between the two of us.” “You hear the power of that voice” Trump said, adding that the North Korean leader “doesn’t do news conferences.” “This is a historic moment, the fact that we’re meeting,” he added. Trump later told U.S. troops at Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, that he noticed that “many people ... from Korea were literally in tears” when he crossed the DMZ but did not cite specific examples. He also said during brief remarks to reporters that sanctions against Pyongyang remain in place but that “at some point during the negotiations things can happen.” In a tweet before leaving South Korea, Trump described his meeting with Kim as “wonderful,” adding that standing on North Korean soil was “an important statement for all.” Leaving South Korea after a wonderful meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Stood on the soil of North Korea, an important statement for all, and a great honor! Despite the historic nature of Trump’s visit to the Korean Peninsula, the outcome essentially got the U.S. and North Korea back to the same place they were before talks broke down four months ago. The Hanoi summit collapsed when Trump refused to accept Kim’s offer of sanctions relief in exchange for shuttering the North’s largest nuclear facility. Washington is looking for far greater concessions from Pyongyang, including a full accounting of their nuclear stockpile, comprehensive inspections and eventually the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Before and during his trip to Asia, Trump had repeatedly hinted about the possibility of meeting with Kim. The two leaders recently resumed contact. Trump said he received what he called a “beautiful letter” from Kim this month containing birthday greetings. In return, the president sent Kim a thank-you note and letter. Trump first publicly suggested the possibility of a brief greeting with Kim at the DMZ in a tweet Friday. In an exclusive interview with The Hill on Monday, Trump said he would be visiting the DMZ and that he “might” meet with Kim. The Hill delayed publishing news of the trip earlier in the week at the request of the White House, which cited security concerns about publicizing the president’s plans that far in advance. Trump said Saturday that the North Korean leader was open to a meeting, but the president noted potential logistical challenges could prevent it from taking place. Sunday's meeting with Kim came after bad weather blocked Trump's attempt to make a surprise visit to the DMZ in November 2017. Trump considered meeting Kim there in 2018 before deciding to hold the first summit between the two leaders in Singapore. This report was updated at 9:04 a.m. View the discussion thread.

347," (CNN)A vacationing Connecticut man is accused of killing a worker at a resort on the eastern Caribbean island of Anguilla, according to local authorities. According to a statement from the Royal Anguilla Police Force, Gavin Hapgood, 44, faces a charge of manslaughter in connection to the death of 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel, a Dominican national and maintenance worker at the Malliouhana resort, in Anguilla -- a British territory in the Caribbean that's a popular tourist destination.  A representative for Hapgood, who was vacationing with his family, said the killing was in self-defense, and that Mitchel was ""armed and demanding money"" when he showed up to Hapgood's hotel room uninvited on April 13.  The circumstances surrounding Mitchel's death remain unclear.  It's also unclear whether Hapgood has hired a US-based attorney. Reached for comment, Thomas Astaphan, a defense attorney for Hapgood in Anguilla. declined to comment.  An autopsy revealed the cause of death was ""prone restraint and positional asphyxia."" There were also signs of blunt force trauma to the head, torso and abdomen, Anguilla police spokesman Randy Dick said in a statement. ""His (Hapgood's) daughters were present when the incident occurred,"" Dick told CNN in an email. Police said they had no prior interactions with the Hapgood family, and that there was no available security-camera footage of the incident from the hotel. Hapgood was subsequently arrested and charged with manslaughter, according to police. He was arraigned on April 17, and was initially denied bail, police said.

""Based on the legal advice that was given a decision was made to charge Mr. Gavin Hapgood for the offence of manslaughter,"" Dick said in a statement on the police department's Facebook page.

""Neither invited nor expected, the worker showed up unannounced in uniform at the hotel room, claiming he was there to fix a broken sink before carrying out his sudden, violent attack on the family,"" Kelcey Kintner, a spokeswoman for Hapgood, said in a statement.  ""A dedicated father and husband and respected member of his community,"" she said, ""(Hapgood) and the members of his family have been traumatized by the assault they survived and are thankful to be alive.""

350,"He was unpredictable. He was aggressively combative. He wasn't really that much of a likeable guy. But he was also a winner. No, I'm not talking about Donald Trump during the 2016 election process, I'm talking about the late General George S. Patton. But the reason the description is so reminiscent of the President-elect is that Trump is trying to emulate him. And the more you know about how Patton talked and acted, the better prepared you'll be for Trump's impending presidency. Trump's admiration for Patton isn't a secret. Even before he formally announced his candidacy for president, Trump started mentioning Patton's name regularly in speeches and interviews. By the time his campaign ended, Trump was mentioning Patton and fellow American war hero General Douglas MacArthur at every rally. Most of the time, he referred to Patton as the kind of leader America needs to defeat ISIS. But Trump has clearly been copying Patton's methods and teachings in a more all-encompassing way than that. Here's an example from Patton's own words that appears to be one of Trump's guiding principles. ""As long as you attack them, they cannot find the time to attack you."" — General George S. Patton Trump's aggressive, often politically incorrect verbal attacks on his opponents became more than just a passing feature of his campaign. Even since his win, he's only slightly softened his tone. Trump seems to continue to appreciate the purpose of a Patton-like first and constant strike attack strategy: It keeps your opponents on the defensive and everyone else talking about you and what you said. This was a big reason Trump gained so much attention despite running in a crowded field in the GOP primaries and against America's most famous female politician in the general election. He made everyone else look like the supporting cast. Look for that combative, strike-first strategy to continue during the rest of the transition period straight through Trump's term in the White House. It certainly has continued through his post-election attacks on CNN, Vanity Fair, former President Bill Clinton, etc. In other words, folks who expect Trump to noticeably tone it down once he takes office don't know Trump and they don't know Patton. Here's another chestnut from the general that Trump seems to live by: ""There is but one international law; the best Army!""— General George S. Patton Of course the easiest place for Trump to emulate Patton is in his capacity as the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. armed forces. Trump is well on his way to doing that. First, he chose the living general most experts believe most resembles Patton — General James Mattis — to be his Secretary of Defense. In fact, Trump himself continues to introduce Mattis as ""the closest thing we have to General George Patton."" But it goes beyond that. Trump has repeatedly complained about what he sees as a weakening of the U.S. military under President Obama. He's calling for steep increases in troop levels and the number of naval ships in the American fleet. That's Pattonesque in many ways. So too is Trump's continued calls for more secrecy and caginess in American foreign and military policy. Trump often mentions MacArthur and Patton when he says he doesn't want to reveal specific plans for military operations, thus giving the enemy a chance to prepare. During a campaign stop in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina late last year, Trump said, ""I don't want my generals being interviewed."" Patton's bluntness and coarseness went beyond words. The general famously almost ended his military career prematurely by slapping a PTSD-suffering soldier at a Army hospital facility in August, 1943. Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall did not fire Patton as a commander, but he was still sidelined from combat command for almost a year. As much as that incident hurt Patton's reputation among some people, his aggressive and frightening nature was confirmed in the eyes of America's enemies. This was especially true of the Germans, who feared Patton above all the other Allied generals. Patton was a weapon his superiors saw as a necessary blunt instrument to win the war. That was why Patton was returned to command in Europe and helped speed the pace of the stalled Allied march to Germany in 1944 and 1945. Much like Patton, many voters see Trump as a similar blunt instrument to smash America's foreign and domestic woes. As president, it's not likely Trump will be slapping any soldiers, but his aggressive style is meant to do more than put his political opponents and media critics off guard. Like Patton, the added goal is to frighten enemies like ISIS, al Qaeda, and terror-supporting regimes like Iran and North Korea. This might mean a bigger American naval presence in disputed waters, or more anti-ISIS bombing raids in Syria and Iraq. Trump promises not to telegraph those kinds of moves, but no one should be surprised if they happen. Domestically, look for some kind of very visible and aggressive moves against attacks on the homeland. A big part of this will indeed be verbal as Trump has continued to immediately blame every attack on ""Islamist terror"" using those exact words usually much earlier than when the perpetrators are actually confirmed. Trump began that trend when he immediately blamed the San Bernardino attack last year on Islamic terror. Like Patton, Trump is likely to act first and ask a lot of the pertinent questions later in response to any future domestic terror attacks. ""Give me an Army of West Point graduates and I'll win a battle... Give me a handful of Texas Aggies and I'll win a war."" — General General George S. Patton This Patton quote, which underscored the general's belief that the Army brass weren't always the best people to get a dirty job done, seems to have played a role in at least some of Trump's cabinet choices. There's actually a real Texas Aggie in that group in former Texas Governor and Energy Secretary-Designate Rick Perry, who graduated from Texas A&M in 1972. But ""Aggies"" are another way of saying the long-held norms about whom we consider to be acceptable cabinet choices don't sit well with the Trump team. That's how you get an oil company CEO picked for Secretary of State, a neurosurgeon chosen to lead HUD, and a pro wrestling industry leader to run the Small Business Administration. They fit Trump's and Patton's image of ""doers"" being better than the supposedly more polished and qualified. All of this of course begs the question: Do we really want a president who seems to want to emulate one of America's all time most aggressive and volatile generals? The easy answer is that if Trump ends up as successful in his ""battles"" and other tests as Patton did, not many people will complain in the end. Trump has always been betting on that exact outcome. He did just that during his many controversial moves during the election, believing that a victory in November would eventually make the criticisms and doubt irrelevant. It'll be different once Trump is president. The stakes are higher and negatives are much more serious than just losing an election. But Trump and his supporters have always had a pretty good retort for those who say he's talking or acting too recklessly. That is, they can and have pointed to the increased number of terror attacks in America and across the world, the growing military and political might of nations like Iran, China, and Russia, and the continuing failures in our public schools and problems with our infrastructure. And while doing so, they can and have asked: ""How has the more reserved and accepted way of doing things been working out for us, not just under President Obama but for the last 30-40 years?"" Like Patton, Trump does not respect a lot of the rules his predecessors have upheld for so long. Those who have knee-jerk positive or negative reactions to this are ignoring the fact that no one can predict what results will come from Trump's disrespect for those conventions. All they can do is react to Trump much like his superiors and enemies did throughout his career and consistently expect the next president of the United States to act aggressively and unexpectedly for the next four years.

351,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian insurer Caixa Seguridade SA decided on Monday to cancel its initial public offering, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, amid concerns about the new coronavirus and plunging oil prices. Controlling shareholder state bank Caixa Economica Federal had been planning to list the insurer in April, but has decided to push it back in three to six months, both sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions are not public yet. The Caixa Seguridade IPO had been expected to raise more than 10 billion reais ($2.12 billion), making it the biggest expected Brazilian initial share offering for 2020. Caixa did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The setback may dampen bankers’ hopes for a record year for IPOs and follow-ons. The expectation that more domestic investors could invest in stocks amid Brazil’s lowest interest rates on record and a more robust economic growth outlook had led a series of companies to test the markets. Bankers were expecting nearly 200 billion reais in share offerings this year. Homebuilders, banks, parking lot operators and retailers are among the 25 companies that have filed for IPOs with Brazil’s securities regulator this year. A potential delay to the Caixa Seguridade IPO could also represent a blow to the government of President Jair Bolsonaro, which had hoped to raise billions of dollars this year through a series of state asset sales which may now fetch a lower price due to the recent market rout. Most companies have not yet taken a final decision about going ahead with their IPO plans or pushing the deals back, said three sources, including one of the people with knowledge of the Caixa Seguridade IPO. As companies have already made their preliminary filings with the securities regulators, they can still wait for roughly two weeks before a final decision. Still, some companies are already nearing moves to pull the plug on planned IPOs, including Banco Daycoval, which had hoped to raise $1 billion in a stock flotation in the coming weeks, a source close to the bank said. Banco Daycoval did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reporting by Carolina Mandl and Aluisio Alves in Sao Paulo; Editing by Christian Plumb and Matthew Lewis"

353,"Phononic is a semiconductor manufacturer that has developed new solid-state cooling and refrigeration technology that displaces compressors, heat sinks and fans — ancient, energy-inefficient technology that's been around for more than 100 years. The Durham, N.C.-based company, launched in 2009, started by selling medical refrigerators used in labs and hospitals. Phononic replaced the compressor with solid-state technology and nontoxic refrigerants to give medical facilities smarter, more precise refrigeration with 40% more storage space. Last year that technology really took off when the company partnered with Thermo Fisher Scientific as the exclusive supplier for its life sciences and health-care solid-state refrigeration and freezer products. Phononic founder and CEO, Tony Atti, the former director of boutique private-equity firm MHI Energy Partners, claims his company's units are nearly silent and use about 25% less energy than a traditional refrigerator. That's attractive to food and beverage companies like Pepsi Bottling, one of Pepsi's biggest distributors. Last year the bottling company installed Phononic refrigerators at the end of aisles and near registers in some North Carolina supermarkets and convenience stores and compared sales at stores where the beverages were in large refrigerators near the back of the store. The Phononic refrigerators had better sales, and now Pepsi Bottling is using them throughout the country. So far Phononic, with 140 employees, has raised close to $160 million from Oak Investment Partners, Venrock Associates and Tsing Capital, among others. Eventually, the company wants to get into commercial and residential cooling so that it can alleviate some of the load on local power grids. It's testing that in Singapore right now in partnership with Temasek-EcoSperity."
354," (CNN)The NBA took swift action and suspended the regular season after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus, but that isn't stopping Dallas Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban from supporting hourly workers at American Airlines Center amid the stoppage. Speaking to reporters after the Mavericks played the Denver Nuggets at home on Wednesday night, Cuban said he has begun to put in place a program to financially support the arena workers. ""I reached out to the folks at the arena and our folks at the Mavs to find out what it would cost to support, financially support, people who aren't going to be able to come to work,"" Cuban said. ""They get paid by the hour, and this was their source of income. So, we'll do some things there. We may ask them to go do some volunteer work in exchange, but we've already started the process of having a program in place. I don't have any details to give, but it's certainly something that's important to me."" With a second player on the Jazz confirmed to have tested for the coronavirus and it being officially declared a pandemic, there is no timetable for when the league will resume play. That means that hourly workers at arenas across the league could be without work for weeks, if not months. It remains to be seen how other teams respond and if they follow Cuban's lead. Cuban's comments come after Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers told reporters, ""We feel for the workers mostly, the low-income wage earners that count on working our games. If you're going to have empathy, have it for them, not for us. We play basketball. It's a big business, but we're just playing basketball.""

355,"Two biotechnology stories from China captured the world’s attention this past week: First, the WSJ reported that a group of doctors in Hangzhou have been using CRISPR gene-editing in experiments with cancer patients. Elsewhere, medical scientists are far more cautious about using the technology in humans. The concern: Clinical trials are not always well regulated around the world. The gene editing activity in China not only flouts the safety-first standard in developed countries and exploits desperate patients, it misses an opportunity to learn from carefully designed clinical trials. Second, more than two decades after Dolly the sheep was cloned, scientists in China reported they had cloned the first primate. It required new techniques and involved dozens of failures before two infant monkeys were finally born with perfect copies of the genes in their cells, creating enormous opportunities for comparative research. What it means: These results reinforce the possibility of using human clones for research. Still, the risks involved in cloning for human reproduction are simply too great, as the many failed attempts at monkey cloning make clear. The bottom line: These developments are a reminder that the U.S. is no longer the sole player. However, science is not a zero-sum game. Along with the need for appropriate regulation, the question now is whether the U.S. is in a position to collaborate and contribute new information. In that sense, the less flashy National Institutes of Health announcement of a $190 million commitment to support work on new tools for gene editing is ultimately the bigger news this week.

356,"Aden, Yemen — One year into the intervention here by the Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia, and backed by the Yemeni National Army, I can tell my people with confidence that we are working hard to restore peace. The Houthi rebels’ military position has been weakened, and peace talks will resume next month. A cease-fire is to begin on April 10, leading up to the talks. The Houthis must respect it. We must now direct our efforts to rebuilding our broken country. Yemen’s war began in the summer of 2014 when the Houthi rebels, joined by soldiers loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, attacked the government’s armed forces in Amran. The rebels went on to occupy Sanaa, the capital, and overthrew Yemen’s legitimately elected government by force that September. Before the Houthi-Saleh insurgents escalated their violence, my government had done everything possible to avoid an all-out war, and the country was undergoing a peaceful political transition. That process was derailed just as the country was putting into place the decisions of the National Dialogue Conference, a forum created by Yemenis and backed by the international community. The Houthis themselves were party to the conference discussions until they intensified their violence. With our country in chaos, we were left with no choice but to call for the assistance of our brothers in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. Without intervention, Yemen’s future might have been that of a largely lawless and feudal country. Because of Yemen’s strategically significant location on the Gulf of Aden, the impact of continuing chaos would have been felt far beyond our borders — in the other Gulf countries, Europe and the United States. Now my government and the coalition have shifted the balance of power on the ground. Nearly 75 percent of the land previously occupied by the Houthi-Saleh forces has been liberated, which is why they decided to participate in serious peace negotiations for the first time. We are already witnessing some results of these peace efforts as fighting along our border with Saudi Arabia has diminished. My country, which boasts a proud heritage and culture dating back more than a thousand years, deserves a chance to thrive again. Defeating extremism requires a coherent government that can provide services to its citizens. We are developing a post-conflict economic recovery program to help Yemen heal. But the world must stand by us as we work to rebuild our country. We urgently need international economic assistance. We especially need to provide employment to Yemen’s youth and take advantage of their enthusiasm for their country’s future. Some progress has begun. With the help of our Arab and Islamic partners, most of the ministers of the government are back in the temporary capital, Aden, carrying out their duties. We hope that with the help of the United Nations the negotiations in April will lead to the reinstatement of Yemen’s peaceful political process and the implementation of the decisions of the National Dialogue Conference, which calls for the formation of a federal state. My government appreciates the United Nations’ work in assisting Yemen, and we will continue to support the efforts of Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the United Nations special envoy. However, for there to be an agreement in the April talks, the Houthi-Saleh forces must accept United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216, which calls for all parties to abide by the peaceful political process and agree to a durable and lasting agreement that allows the government to begin the work of returning displaced people to their homes and repairing damage. A final peace agreement must have uncompromising measures to uphold Yemen’s security. We will shut down, once and for all, the terrorist safe havens and again work with the West and Arab partners to rid our territory of the extremists who plot attacks on targets in the United States, Europe, Arab states and elsewhere. Already, in the past two weeks, the government of Yemen started a campaign in Aden against terrorist organizations and militarized extremist groups. The campaign has normalized the security situation in Aden. Now my government is working to bring similar campaigns to other regions. In addition, it must be made clear to Iran, which seeks to expand its sphere of control through its Houthi proxies, that Yemen will not yield a single inch of territory to outside forces. I assumed the presidency in 2012 while my country was in a state of political turmoil and plagued by insecurity. Even before then, there were many longstanding unsettled issues. Now we must turn to the urgent task of reconciliation. In the years before the Houthi-Saleh violence escalated into a civil war, Yemen was making significant progress through clearly defined guidelines laid out by the National Dialogue Conference. Using the same steps and measures, these guidelines must be adhered to when we address the repercussions of the Houthi-Saleh coup. Our government extends its hand in a peace that is sustainable and does not compromise Yemen’s state-building process. While challenges remain, the country’s outlook is brighter today than at any time over the past year. Violence has diminished, and negotiations are scheduled. Peace is attainable. We see a future in which Yemen is stable and thriving and provides equal opportunity, better living conditions and an equal place in society for all. We must not give up hope."

But for some reason, Senate Republicans are choosing to keep our schools closed & kids at home over one percent. #WV families deserve better. When I visited with educators two weeks ago at the state capitol, they told me they want to be back in their classrooms. I urge the Senate Republican leadership to stop playing games and send our kids back to school. West Virginia teachers extended their strike into its eighth school day in a row on Monday as they continue to fight with state lawmakers for wage increases. The strike began on Feb. 22 in response to low wages amid skyrocketing health insurance costs.  The governor and teachers’ union reached an agreement to end the strike last week that included a 5 percent pay raise. However, the state Senate voted to cut the pay raise, causing the strike to march on. All public schools in the state’s 55 counties will remain closed until the strike is resolved. The closure is affecting nearly 277,000 students and 35,000 employees, The Associated Press reported. Nearly one-quarter of all children are living in poverty in West Virginia, so teachers packed hundreds of food bags for students in need even as they were on strike.  View the discussion thread.

362,"Hong Kong (CNN)They are at the cutting-edge of America's elite stealth jet technology, capable of seamlessly connecting pilots for co-ordinated missions. And now Singapore wants to become the fourth country to enmesh US F-35 warplanes above and around the South China Sea -- a move likely to be greeted with trepidation in Beijing. In a speech before Parliament last week, Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen announced a plan to buy up to 12 F-35 warplanes from the US. If the deal goes through, Singapore will become the fourth American ally in the Pacific to own them. The purchase would require US congressional approval, but Ng said that both the Trump administration and the Pentagon favored the deal. ""Next Gen Singapore Armed Forces will be more lethal in all domains,"" read a graphic shown to legislators during the defense minister's presentation.

While Singapore has allowed US ships and aircraft usage of some of our military facilities, this is not a reaction to any recent developments. It is a long-standing arrangement dating back to 1990,"" said the Ministry of Defense. ""Singapore's defense policies are predicated on an inclusive security architecture, as exemplified by the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM)-Plus which consists of all ten ASEAN countries and eight Plus countries, namely Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Russia and the US."" But analysts say the country's decision to acquire F-35 technology is indicative of growing concerns within Asia regarding China's regional ambitions.  ""Singapore probably does not trust China's assurances that its South China Sea claims are benign, without military intentions and will not result in China taking control of air and sea commerce,"" said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center. Singapore sits on the western approaches to the South China Sea. China has claimed almost the entire 1.3-million-square-mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. It has aggressively asserted its stake in recent years in the face of conflicting claims from several Southeast Asian nations, building up and fortifying islands in the Spratly and Paracel chains. The US has steadfastly contested those claims, sending warships on freedom of navigation operations near the islands and regularly flying reconnaissance -- and sometimes bomber -- flights over the South China Sea. When it acquires the F-35s, Singapore will join US allies Australia, Japan and South Korea in operating the jets in the Pacific. The US also has F-35s based in Japan, and they can operate off US Navy ships moving through the region. Even the United Kingdom said earlier this year it would send an aircraft carrier with F-35s into the region in 2020. US officials have previously dismissed the idea they are pursuing a cold war or containment policy in regards to China in the Pacific, but Singapore's decision to join the list of F-35 capable countries risks strengthening that divide between the US and China.   ""Beijing should see in this development evidence that there remains strong demand in the Asia-Pacific region for a US presence,"" said Timothy Heath, senior defense analyst at the RAND Corp. ""The network of air forces that employ the F-35 expands the possibility that these militaries could work together in a coalition if necessary. This development can provide a robust deterrence message to China regarding its behavior in the South and East China seas,"" Heath said. Coordination among allies The F-35's advanced electronic warfare suite can allow seamless integration among allied users and that could be cause for concern in Beijing. Peter Layton, defense analyst at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia, says the F-35's stealth and electronic warfare capabilities make it a ""force multiplier."" F-35s are able to sneak past air defenses and send detailed targeting information to trailing planes carrying long-range missiles or to land-based anti-ship missile systems, he added. ""The acquisition may spur China to think about how it can improve its air defense network in the South China Sea and on ships to detect and target stealth aircraft such as Singapore's F-35,"" said Layton. Previous F-35 purchases from US allies have prompted bravado from Chinese media. A January report in the state-sponsored Global Times brushed away any threat from ""the US F-35 friends circle"" in the Asia-Pacific, with Chinese analysts saying the F-35 was no match for China's fifth-generation stealth jet, the J-20. Yet even though the F-35 procurement sends strong signals to China, analysts agree that Singapore is sending them carefully.  Defense Minister Ng did not mention China when revealing purchase plans last week. His presentation to Parliament said only that the jets ""will significantly contribute to the (air force's) ability to safeguard Singapore's sovereignty and security."" He also said the country was being deliberate in how it acquired them, buying four with its first order and then adding up to eight others if the first batch fit requirements. 'Low-key player' The F-35s would eventually work in concert with Singapore's US-built F-15s when they replace the country's F-16s, which will be obsolete in a decade, the defense minister said. Singapore has been a close and longtime US ally -- it evens leases space for a US Navy logistics and support facility and has hosted forward deployments of US Navy littoral combat ships. But it tends to be a low-key player in military matters. ""Despite good relations with the United States, Singapore generally remains reluctant to take a leadership role in challenging Chinese power due to its small size and depth of economic ties with China,"" Heath said. Schuster added: ""Singapore does not want to anger China... Singapore tends to act quietly and with nuance and subtlety."" However, the subtle approach should not be mistaken for military weakness. Australia's Lowy Institute ranked Singapore's military power 10th among 25 Asian nations last year -- just behind Australia and ahead of larger countries like Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. Singapore boasts quality military hardware and strong defense relationships in the region. ""Singapore sees its role as a facilitator of regional security and stability, not as a member of any alliance directed at any particular nation,"" said Schuster. Update: This report has been updated to include comments from the Singaporean Defense Ministry. "

365,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan +0.31%; Nikkei +0.39% * Analysts see widespread uncertainty, continued risk aversion * Brent crude wavers around $70 per barrel * Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 SHANGHAI, May 28 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged up on Tuesday lifted by gains in China and as auto firms climbed on merger news, but broad uncertainties over trade and economic growth kept a lid on gains. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.31%, and U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures rose 0.19% to 2,837.25. Chinese blue-chips rose 1.02% a day after data showed Chinese industrial firms' profits shrank in April, which is expected to prompt more government stimulus to support the slowing economy. A planned increase in the weighting of Chinese A-shares in MSCI indexes after the market close later on Tuesday also boosted shares. Seoul's KOSPI added 0.13%, while Australian shares were up 0.45%. Japan's Nikkei stock index gained 0.39%. Despite the day's gains, Joanne Goh, Asia equity strategist at DBS in Singapore, said that broad market sentiment remained uncertain ahead of a possible meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at the G20 summit next month. ""There's still a lack of direction in the markets in terms of all the different asset classes,"" she said. ""You actually see Chinese bond yields are ticking up, but that shouldn't be the case because we are expecting stimulus and bond yields should start to come off...there's quite a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now."" Ten-year Chinese government bond futures for September delivery, the most-traded contract, jumped 0.26% on Tuesday after having dropped as much as 0.71% the day before, after China's takeover of a troubled bank sparked concerns of wider financial risks. ""With economic indicators mixed and trade war risks lingering, the bias is still tilted towards loose monetary policy to cushion growth. We think that the rise in longer-term (Chinese) govvie...yields is probably not warranted,"" DBS analysts said in a note. The equity market gains in Asia followed a relatively light session in Europe on Monday, with UK and U.S. financial markets closed for holidays. European auto shares had rallied after Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler confirmed it had made a ""transformative merger"" proposal to French peer Renault in a deal which would create the world's third-biggest carmaker. That sector rally spilled into Asia with Mitsubishi Motors Corp in Japan adding 4.31% and Nissan Motor Co gaining 2.51%. Shares in Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd jumped 6.11%. Provisional results from EU elections also buoyed markets after pro-union parties kept a firm grip on power in elections to the European Parliament. The pan-European STOXX 600 added 0.22%. ""Although Eurosceptic and anti-establishment parties didn't win as many seats as expected, their influence has increased significantly. This could have implications for the political colour of key EU positions,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank. ""The Parliament composition is also likely to have implications on the priority agenda for future EU reform, particularly with respect to things like immigration, fiscal spending and fiscal union,"" he added, noting a decrease in bond yields pointed to continued risk aversion. The yield on benchmark 10-year German Bunds fell to -0.147% on Monday, its lowest since September 2016. On Tuesday, U.S. yields were also lower. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yielded 2.3061%. The two-year yield touched 2.1661%. Trade worries remain high on investors' list of concerns. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Washington was not ready to make a deal with Beijing but he expected one in the future, while at the same time pressing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to even out a trade imbalance with the United States. The dollar was barely weaker against the yen at 109.47 , and fell 0.13% against the euro, with the common currency buying $1.1181. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.20% higher at 97.806. In commodity markets, oil prices wavered after rising more than 1% on Monday on tensions in the Middle East and OPEC-led supply cuts, as well as continuing Russian supply disruptions after a contamination problem discovered last month. Brent crude was 0.1% lower at $70.04 per barrel, having earlier dipped below the $70 mark, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 0.82% to $59.11 per barrel. Spot gold was down 0.12% at $1,283.21 per ounce. Bitcoin, which on Monday touched $8,939.18, its highest in more than a year, was up 0.3% at $8,797.4, turning around from an earlier drop.

366,"* U.S. Retail sales data tops expectations * German investor morale survey worse-than-expected * Mounting no-deal Brexit worries knock pound (Updates with open of U.S. markets, changes dateline; previous LONDON) NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - A gauge of global equities edged lower on Tuesday and U.S. Treasury yields climbed as a stronger-than-anticipated report on retail sales raised the possibility that a second rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year could be pushed back by several months. U.S. retail sales rose 0.4% in June, as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and a variety of other goods. The solid number comes on the heels of recent data showing a strong labor market and a pickup in consumer prices. While the Fed is still largely expected to cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its July 30-31 policy meeting, expectations for a more aggressive half a percentage point cut have been scaled back. ""One of the things I have been wringing my hands over is this divergence between very strong consumer confidence and retail sales that have just been going nowhere so maybe we are starting to close the gap,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. ""I dont know if this is going to take the Fed off its July easing plan but it could perhaps push the second rate reduction out a few months."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 17.04 points, or 0.06%, to 27,376.2, the S&P 500 fell 3.12 points, or 0.10%, to 3,011.18 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.50 points, or 0.12%, to 8,248.68. With earnings season underway, banking shares were in focus after a mixed bag of results from JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. The S&P banks sector was off 0.2%. Other data showed manufacturing output in the U.S. picked up steam in June, while import prices declined the most in six months. The data boosted U.S. Treasury yields, while the improving economic picture has seen the U.S. yield curve steepen in the past week. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.1288%, compared with 2.092% late on Monday. European equities rose as disappointing data out of Germany and new concerns over Brexit helped boost expectations for stimulus from the European Central Bank. Germany's ZEW indicator showed that the mood among investors in Europe's largest economy deteriorated more than expected in July, with the survey pointing to the unresolved China-U.S. trade dispute and to political tensions with Iran. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.38% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.08%. The dollar strengthened versus the euro as a result of the disparate data while a debate between the two candidates to become Britain's next prime minister sent the pound tumbling because of heightened worries about a no-deal Brexit. The dollar index rose 0.35%, with the euro down 0.34% to $1.1219. Sterling was last trading at $1.2415, down 0.81% on the day. Oil prices steadied as a resumption of production in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Barry and a boom in U.S. supply from shale oil countered tensions in the Middle East. U.S. crude rose 0.03% to $59.60 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.76, up 0.42% on the day. (Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)"

368,"Tesla’s referral program is a key ingredient to its brand success – it rewards owners for recruiting new buyers, with benefits like invitations to special events, including the recent Model 3 employee handover. Now, a new Level 2 bonus for people who recruit the most has been discovered by Teslarati: A chance to drive a Boring Company tunnel borer. This is unlikely to be the thrill ride that you get from driving a P100D in Ludicrous Mode, for instance; Boring machines tend to crawl at very slow speeds, since they’re digging through pounds of dense material and also need to help make sure cave-ins don’t happen. This reward comes with the promise of driving an electric tunnel boring matching at The Boring Company in Hawthorne, where SpaceX is, too. The Boring Co. has already begun work on its first tunnel, and even installed an elevator designed to lower cargo into its depths. Again, this Boring Co. drive will probably actually be “boring,” and I’m not just saying that for the pun. But it’s still an undeniably cool opportunity, and a good carrot for the referral program."
369,"Nearly five years ago the state of Kansas underwent what was dubbed a real live ""experiment"" in tax reform when Republican Gov. Sam Brownback enacted a tax package that brought down personal income-tax rates and also eliminated income tax for pass-through entities. These included LLCs, S-corps, partnerships, farms and sole proprietorships. The idea was to stimulate the local economy with spending, hiring and small-business growth. The majority of small businesses in America are structured as pass-throughs, passing through their business income to owners who are then taxed at the individual level. Entrepreneurs like Kelly McCracken, owner of Amazing Smiles of Kansas City, saw savings of thousands of dollars a year under Brownback's cuts, allowing her to invest in her business. For her company the experiment worked as planned. ""We hired other small businesses to help with our website and SEO, we hired another employee and most recently made a durable equipment purchase,"" she said. But in June of 2017, the Kansas State Legislature reversed the experiment, reinstating taxes for pass-throughs. The reason: The tax cuts caused the state to have a budget shortfall in the billions in less than five years, according to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.- based advocacy group. The Tax Foundation also claimed that the cumulative budget deficits in fiscal 2018 and 2019 alone were $850 million. The experiment also drained funding for the school system, state pensions and road maintenance. Under the reversal, individual rates range from 2.9 percent to 5.2 percent and will increase again in 2018. Businesses like McCracken's also have to pay retroactive taxes for 2017. For protection, she's taken out a line of credit while she plans what's next for her company. ""Just a few thousand dollars alters your usable income for the year. It greatly impacts these decisions we made just months ago, without the plan or knowledge this was going to be coming in the future,"" she said. Critics of Brownback's plan say it reflects why similar cuts proposed by the Trump administration — bringing the business tax rate to 15 percent from a top rate of 39.6 percent and including pass-through businesses in that bracket — may not stimulate the economy. In May, prior to the tax cuts being reversed, Brownback told CNBC the state had seen ""record small-business creation in the last five years"" and claimed that the conversion rate of C-corps to LLCs in order to benefit from the tax breaks was no higher than usual. ""So I think, as a strategy it's the right strategy, and that's how you grow the country, and that's how you grow the state,"" Brownback said. Trump's target of 15 percent ""might really be the right point to be able to stimulate growth."" The governor's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The Tax Foundation reported that new business filings grew 11 percent between 2012 and 2014 and another 10 percent through 2016, adding that new pass-through businesses were being set up at a fast rate under the new policy. State Democratic Party Chair John Gibson, who was against the experiment, said that while the cuts were supposed to ""turbocharge"" the state's economy, the opposite has happened and it's instead lagging behind neighboring states, like Nebraska and Missouri. ""We have not seen those benefits, and what we have seen, unfortunately, are our schools getting shortchanged, our highway fund being raided,"" he said. ""Really, the investment in the future of Kansas has been put off and kicked down the road so that a few extremely wealthy individuals have been able to save money on their Kansas taxes."" Gibson also has a legal business, FreeState Patent Services, which is structured as an LLC. In the past few years, he did not pay income taxes on his earnings in the practice. He said the experiment allowed for wealthy individuals to structure their income as pass-through, allowing them to avoid paying income tax at the state level. ""It's a few thousand dollars over a few years. It's not a large impact on my bottom line,"" he said. ""What is proposed as a small-business tax break is actually not about small businesses. It's about effectively eliminating taxes on a handful of extraordinarily wealthy individuals to the detriment of the rest of us."" Other small businesses, like Karl Miller's Lark Label in Wichita, echoed Gibson's point in not seeing enough savings to benefit from the experiment. His company has been around for 20 years and has three employees, including Miller. Being structured as an LLC saved him some $1,400 a year max under the experiment, he said, nowhere near enough to hire a new employee. ""As a small-business guy, I'm always in favor of additional money in my pocket, less taxation,"" he said. ""I don't think you'll find a person who will argue against less taxation. At the same time, I do believe in it. I enjoy driving down a good road; I enjoy the fact that I've got clean water and sewage and police protection. Those are all good things worth paying taxes for."" Beyond Kansas, Miller said he favors federal tax reform but said the Trump administration needs to learn from the lessons the Kansas experiment has provided. The issue is key for small businesses nationwide, ranking a top-three concern, according to the conservative lobbying group the National Federation of Independent Business, which advocates for parity between corporations and small businesses when it comes to tax reform. ""We have a very good example here where it didn't really work out,"" he said. ""Not to say the entire concept is bad, but it needs to be changed up slightly to make sure that not so much money goes out that it causes economic problems for the government."""

On Saturday, the Sanders campaign appeared to shift its focus, calling for the removal of Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy as a co-chairman of the platform committee and former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank as co-head of the rules committee. The demand, coming after a separate deal with the DNC involving the platform committee that won plaudits from people in the Sanders camp, is a challenge to Wasserman Schultz to make additional changes.  “Governor Malloy and Mr. Frank have both been aggressive attack surrogates for the Clinton campaign,” Sanders campaign counsel Brad Deutsch wrote in a letter to the party’s rules and bylaws committee. “Their criticisms of Senator Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the Senator and his Campaign.”   The letter said Frank had criticized Sanders as far back as 1991 and that in a March interview he had described the Vermont senator as “outrageously McCarthyite.” It also noted that Frank has offered acerbic comments toward Sanders supporters. Malloy was described by Deutsch as an “incendiary critic” of Sanders and one who unfairly blamed loopholes in gun control laws on the Vermont senator. Sanders’s request is a challenge to Wasserman Schultz — she could take things into her own hands and pressure Frank and Malloy to leave their committees, even though there is not a formal mechanism for her to do so. Senior party officials wrote the Sanders campaign a response letter Saturday dismissing its request, explaining that it failed to cite a violation of rules governing the conduct of elections or delegate selection.    Sanders supporters are likely to point to this refusal as evidence that the DNC is not willing to go far enough to create a level playing field at the national convention this July. But if Wasserman Schultz were to ask Frank and Malloy to resign from their posts, they would be under heavy pressure to comply. Doing so would earn her goodwill with Sanders supporters, who argue she has tilted the Democratic primary in favor of Clinton. But it’s something of an Augean task — Frank and Malloy were appointed months ago and ratified by a vote of the DNC’s executive board, of which Wasserman Schultz is a member.  “There is no formal mechanism for the chair to remove members since they were voted on back in January,” a party official told The Hill Saturday. “In the case of a vacancy, the exec committee would have to reconvene to vote on the appointment.” Faced with talk of her own resignation to appease Sanders supporters, Wasserman Schultz has made it clear she will not leave her post without a fight.

Some influential Democrats have also said the Sanders campaign has gone too far in suggesting Wasserman Schultz should be removed.  “This is absolutely the wrong time to consider that,” Feinstein, who supports Clinton but is a respected pragmatic voice in the Democratic caucus, said this week. “To use this as a wedge issue in a campaign, I think, is kind of dreadful. It’s not what Democrats are all about. There’s a regular order for making these changes.” Wasserman Schultz made a significant concession to Sanders this past week by allowing him to pick five members of the 15-person platform-drafting committee ahead of the convention. The committee will write the draft platform to be later approved by the full 187-member platform committee. To further placate critics, the DNC announced Friday that it would hold four forums around the country on the party platform in the weeks ahead, to give rank-and-file progressives more input. The first two sessions will solicit testimony; the third will be a meeting of the drafting committee to put ideas to paper; and the fourth will be a gathering of the full platform committee. “I was very concerned that the DNC was failing to provide a fair playing field for the presidential candidates, but the action taken Monday, in which there was an appropriate and fair allocation of platform seats, may well represent the pivot where the DNC got the message,” said Sen.

If they’re changing pathways, that’s certainly a response to the concerns many of us have raised,” he added. Pro-Sanders lawmakers want the party’s platform to embrace his proposals, including calls to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and expand Medicare and Social Security benefits. Clinton initially endorsed raising the wage floor to $12 an hour but later said that as president she would sign a bill raising it to $15 an hour. A Senate Democratic aide said Wasserman Schultz’s fate will depend largely on whether Clinton, the likely nominee, wants to keep her on as the convention nears.

While Republicans still face their own challenges in unifying around Trump, the last few weeks have highlighted discord on the Democratic side and raised questions about whether Clinton can attract young Sanders supporters. Several Democratic senators who support Clinton fear the DNC chair has become a drag on her. Sanders and his surrogates have repeatedly criticized Wasserman Schultz’s decisions, such as the debate schedule and the DNC’s joint fundraising committee for Clinton.  They were also angered by public comments Wasserman Schultz made criticizing Sanders and his supporters for chaos at the Nevada Democratic state convention earlier this month.  Sanders is also demanding changes to party rules that could make it easier for outsider candidates to compete in Democratic contests, heightening pressure on Wasserman Schultz to change things up. Specifically, Sanders wants to see the DNC create incentives to allow independents to vote in future presidential primaries and the influence of the superdelegates to be reduced. Under the current rules, every Democrat in Congress is automatically a superdelegate. Many of them endorsed Clinton before votes were cast in the first primary contest, putting Sanders at a significant disadvantage from the start.   “We need to reform the Democratic primary process. It’s time to open up all our primaries to include independents,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, a progressive advocacy group with 270,000 members that backs Sanders. “If we need independents to win in November, we need to let independents help us choose our candidate. We need to get rid of superdelegates.” View the discussion thread.

371," (This version of the April 20 story was corrected to remove the incorrect mention of GDP impact in paragraph four) By Ana Isabel Martinez and Diego Oré PEDERNALES/QUITO, Ecuador (Reuters) - Ecuador will temporarily increase some taxes, sell assets, and may issue new bonds on the international market to fund a multi-billion dollar reconstruction after a devastating 7.8 magnitude quake, a somber President Rafael Correa said on Wednesday. The death toll from Ecuador’s weekend earthquake neared 600 and rescue missions ebbed as the traumatized Andean nation braced itself for long and costly rebuilding. “It’s hard to imagine the magnitude of the tragedy. Every time we visit a place, there are more problems,” Correa said, fresh from touring the disaster zone. The leftist leader estimated the disaster had inflicted $2 billion to $3 billion of damage. Lower oil revenue had already left the poor nation of 16 million people facing near-zero growth and lower investment. In addition to $600 million in credit from multilateral lenders, Correa, an economist, announced a raft of measures to help repair homes, roads, and bridges along the devastated Pacific Coast. “We’re looking at the possibility of issuing bonds on the international market,” he said on Wednesday afternoon, without providing details. Ecuador had been saying before the quake that current high yields would make it too expensive to issue debt. Yields on its bonds are close to 11 percentage points higher than comparable U.S. Treasury debt, according to JPMorgan data, and creditors are likely to be wary after the quake. Correa’s government in 2008 defaulted on debt with a similar yield, calling the value unfair. His government has since returned to Wall Street and Ecuador currently has some $3.5 billion worth of bonds in circulation. In a nationally televised address later on Wednesday, Correa also announced the OPEC nation was poised to shed assets. “The country has many assets thanks to investment over all these years and we will seek to sell some of them to overcome these difficult moments,” he said. He also unveiled several short-term tax changes, including a 2-point increase in the Valued Added Tax for a year, as well as a “one-off 3 percent additional contribution on profits,” although the fine print was not immediately clear. The VAT tax is currently 12 percent. Additionally, a one-off tax of 0.9 percent will be imposed on people with wealth of over $1 million. Ecuadoreans will also be asked to contribute one day of salary, calculated on a sliding scale based on income. Briefly pausing talk of reconstruction and hindering rescuers, another quake, of 6.2 magnitude, shook the coast before dawn on Wednesday, terrifying survivors. “You can’t imagine what a fright it was. ‘Not again!’ I thought,” said Maria Quinones in Pedernales town, which bore the brunt of Saturday’s disaster. That quake, the worst in decades, killed 570 people, injured 7,000 others, damaged close to 2,000 buildings, and forced over 24,000 survivors to seek refuge in shelters, according to government tallies. Four days on, some isolated communities struggled without water, power or transport, as torn-up roads stymied deliveries. Along the coast, stadiums served as morgues and aid distribution centers. “I’m waiting for medicines, diapers for my grandson, we’re lacking everything,” said Ruth Quiroz, 49, as she waited in an hour-long line in front of a makeshift pharmacy set up at the Pedernales stadium. On a highway outside the town, some children sat holding placards saying: “Food, please.” When a truck arrived to deliver water to the small town of San Jacinto, hungry residents surrounded the vehicle and hit it as they yelled: “We want food!” Scores of foreign aid workers and experts have arrived in the aftermath of Saturday’s disaster and about 14,000 security personnel have kept order, with only sporadic looting reported. But rescuers were losing hope of finding anyone alive even as relatives of the missing begged them to keep looking. Speaking from the highland capital, Quito, Correa said the death toll would likely rise further, although at a slower rate than in previous days. “May these tears fertilize the soil of the future,” he said.

373,"IT WAS a red-letter day for Hebrew literature. On June 14th David Grossman, one of Israel’s most celebrated authors, won the Man Booker International Prize for “A Horse Walks Into a Bar”. Also on the shortlist of six was another Israeli, Amos Oz. For a small country whose politicians normally gush over any international accolade, the response was uncharacteristically terse. It took Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, nearly 24 hours to post a single sentence of congratulation. Mr Netanyahu’s reticence is indicative of a cold war between right-wing nationalists and the country’s left-leaning cultural elite, epitomised by Mr Grossman. The two men clashed in 2015 when Mr Grossman was among a group of writers who renounced their candidacy for the Israel Prize for Literature after Mr Netanyahu tried to remove some judges who he claimed were “anti-Zionist”. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Mr Grossman received the Booker for one of his least political books. But for more than three decades he has been an eloquent critic of Israel’s policies in the territories it occupied in 1967. “Yellow Wind”, a collection of essays on the condition of Palestinians under Israeli rule published in 1987, is still considered one of the sharpest depictions of the 50-year-old occupation of the West Bank. Jessica Cohen, who shared in Mr Grossman’s prize for translating the book into English from Hebrew, said she would donate half of her award to B’Tselem, an Israeli human-rights group. It was a pointed rebuke to Mr Netanyahu, who had recently said he would support a law that would prevent such groups receiving money from foreign governments. Some of Mr Netanyahu’s cabinet ministers offered more generous praise, even if they remain eager culture warriors. Among them is Naftali Bennett, the education minister, whose ministry recently blocked the inclusion on the state curriculum of a novel featuring a romance between an Israeli and Palestinian. Another is Miri Regev, the culture minister, who has backed the exclusion of a play from a theatre festival because it was about Palestinian prisoners. Ms Regev, a former army censor, has also threatened to withdraw state funding from a cultural festival for staging a play featuring nudity, saying it would harm Israel’s Jewish values. Still, at least she tolerates terrible puns. “Grossman is definitely a winning horse,” she said of his book’s award. Correction: This article was updated on July 5th to reflect the fact that the book on the Israeli-Palestinian romance did not in fact feature on the state curriculum. It was recommended for inclusion by the ministry's professional committe, but this recommendation was overturned."
374,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States accused China on Friday of putting well more than a million minority Muslims in “concentration camps,” in some of the strongest U.S. condemnation to date of what it calls Beijing’s mass detention of mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups.  The comments by Randall Schriver, who leads Asia policy at the U.S. Defense Department, are likely to increase tension with Beijing, which is sensitive to international criticism and describes the sites as vocational education training centers aimed at stemming the threat of Islamic extremism.  Former detainees have described to Reuters being tortured during interrogation at the camps, living in crowded cells and being subjected to a brutal daily regimen of party indoctrination that drove some people to suicide.  Some of the sprawling facilities are ringed with razor wire and watch towers.  “The (Chinese) Communist Party is using the security forces for mass imprisonment of Chinese Muslims in concentration camps,” Schriver told a Pentagon briefing during a broader discussion about China’s military, estimating that the number of detained Muslims could be “closer to 3 million citizens.”   Schriver, an assistant secretary of defense, defended his use of a term normally associated with Nazi Germany as appropriate, under the circumstances.  When asked by a reporter why he used the term, Schriver said that it was justified “given what we understand to be the magnitude of the detention, at least a million but likely closer to 3 million citizens out of a population of about 10 million.””So a very significant portion of the population, (given) what’s happening there, what the goals are of the Chinese government and their own public comments make that a very, I think, appropriate description,” he said.  The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday used the term re-education camps to describe the sites and said Chinese activity was “reminiscent of the 1930s.”   The U.S. government has weighed sanctions against senior Chinese officials in Xinjiang, a vast region bordering central Asia that is home to millions of Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities. China has warned that it would retaliate “in proportion” against any U.S. sanctions.  The governor of Xinjiang in March directly dismissed comparisons to concentration camps, saying they were “the same as boarding schools.”  U.S. officials have said China has made criminal many aspects of religious practice and culture in Xinjiang, including punishment for teaching Muslim texts to children and bans on parents giving their children Uighur names.  Academics and journalists have documented grid-style police checkpoints across Xinjiang and mass DNA collection, and human rights advocates have decried martial law-type conditions there.

375,"Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 19 shots for his third shutout of the season and also hit the 20-win mark for the 12th time in his career while leading the visiting Vegas Golden Knights to a 3-0 victory over the Nashville Predators on Saturday night. It was the 59th career shutout for Fleury, breaking a tie with Predators goaltender Pekka Rinne for 19th place on the NHL’s all-time list and moving into a tie with Evgeni Nabokov for 18th place. It also was the 459th career victory for the first pick of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft which kept him in a tie for fifth place with Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers, who shut out the Detroit Red Wings, 1-0, earlier Saturday. Chandler Stephenson, Nicolas Roy and Reilly Smith scored for Vegas which won both ends of a back-to-back that started with a 4-3 victory at Carolina on Friday. Rinne finished with 36 saves for Nashville, which had a two-game winning streak snapped. Vegas dominated a scoreless first period, holding Nashville without a shot for a stretch of 16:37 while finishing with a 14-2 edge in shots on goal, with the Predators blocking 11 more shots. The Golden Knights finally broke through early in the second period to take a 1-0 lead on Stephenson’s 10th goal of the season. Mark Stone won a battle for the puck by the boards and then found Stephenson breaking in alone behind a pair of Nashville defenders. Stephenson then beat Rinne with a wrist shot on his blocker side. Roy then made it 2-0 midway through the third period when he roofed a rebound of a Ryan Reaves shot from the right side of the net for his third goal of the season. Nashville pulled Rinne for an extra attacker with 1:15 to go and Smith then sealed the win with an empty-netter, his 21st goal of the season. —Field Level Media "
376,"Washington (CNN)The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday advanced a slate of judicial nominees to the floor for a vote, including Jonathan Kobes to be a US Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, despite the fact that he was rated ""not qualified"" to serve on the circuit court by the American Bar Association.  The nomination was approved by the committee by an 11-10 vote.  Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii criticized the move, saying after the vote that the White House had ""nominated someone profoundly unfit to serve for a lifetime on the circuit court, but who will nonetheless be confirmed basically on a party line vote."" Controversy over the nomination marks the latest partisan clash over President Donald Trump's judicial picks. It comes less than a week after Senate Republicans successfully confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to be the newest Supreme Court Justice over Democratic opposition and after he vehemently denied sexual assault allegations leveled against him by Christine Blasey Ford. Kavanaugh was confirmed with 50 ""yes"" votes -- the fewest for any Supreme Court justice in the modern era.  In his opening remarks, Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, defended Kobes, who works as a general counsel for Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and saying that the panel had ""received numerous letters of support"" in favor of his confirmation from the state's ""legal community, including South Dakota's attorney general."" Grassley accused the ABA of ""politicizing"" the nomination and criticized its methodology.  Natalie Krings, a spokesperson for Rounds, also defended Kobes in a statement, saying that his ""qualifications to be a circuit judge speak for themselves."" ""The ABA's use of limited criteria when assessing nominees is well known,"" Krings said. ""Jon's qualifications to be a circuit judge speak for themselves. As a practicing attorney for nearly two decades, Jon has amassed an impressive resume that includes service in all three branches of the federal government, as a litigator on behalf of both plaintiffs and defendants in court and in both criminal and civil cases."" She added, ""There are few with as wide a range of experience and as academically qualified as Jon. He demonstrated as such during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee."" In September, the chair of the ABA's standing committee on the federal judiciary wrote in a letter to Grassley and the panel's top Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein that the committee had rated Kobes ""not qualified"" to serve on the appeals court for the Eighth Circuit. The letter came after Trump announced the nomination in June.  ""The committee believes that Mr. Kobes has neither the requisite experience nor evidence of his ability to fulfill the scholarly writing required of a United States Circuit Court Judge,"" the letter said.   It went on to say, ""The Standing Committee had difficulty analyzing Mr. Kobes' professional competence because he was unable to provide sufficient writing samples of the caliber required to satisfy Committee members that he was capable of doing the work of a United States Circuit Court judge.""  In arguing in support of the nominee during Thursday's hearing, Grassley pointed out that the ABA said in its letter that it did not have ""any question about Mr. Kobes' integrity or temperament,"" issues that loomed large in the end for Kavanaugh.  The letter also stated that Kobes is ""a very accomplished, competent and capable person,"" but said that ""his career path has not resulted in sufficient evidence of a developed ability to do the written work of a United States Circuit Court Judge.""  The judiciary committee also moved on Thursday to hold over the nomination of another judicial nominee -- John O'Connor -- who was rated as ""not qualified"" by the ABA.  According to a letter from the ABA to the Judiciary Committee, a review of O'Connor, who has been nominated to be United States District Judge for the Northern, Eastern and Western Districts of Oklahoma, ""revealed several instances of ethical concerns, including candor with the court, evidence of overbilling of clients ... and improper contact with adverse parties in litigation.""   O'Connor did not immediately return CNN's request for comment.  In August, however, Republican Sens. Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, both of Oklahoma, criticized the ABA's rating of O'Connor.  ""In his 37 years of practice, John O'Connor has been known by all to be an attorney of the highest competence, honesty and integrity. He has received the highest possible ethical and legal rating from his peers during his decades of practice, and has been recognized for his continued service to community and civic organizations,"" Inhofe said at the time.

377,"After recent incidents in which police officers shot black men who tried to stop a shooting, African-American gun owners told us how they navigate being wrongly perceived as a threat. Kyle Doheny and Michael Anderson are licensed gun owners who live in different states but have a few things in common. Both are black men who have worked in public safety or national defense. And both say that when they carry their guns, some people don’t respect their Second Amendment rights. The two were among the more than 100 people who responded when we asked black gun owners to tell us about their interactions with law enforcement, other authorities and the general public. Since July, at least three black men in the United States have been shot by police in separate incidents while trying, according to witnesses, to stop an active shooting. A quarter of black men and women in a 2017 Pew survey said they own guns. Some of those who wrote us said they have had no issues with authorities or the general public. Others said they have faced fearful store owners and had confrontations with law enforcement over guns they carried legally; and explained why, despite the stereotyping and sometimes outright hostility they face, they still carry a gun. Here is a selection of their stories. They have been condensed and lightly edited. As a retired airman, I feel as if I am not entitled to the same rights I defended. I am scared of being shot by police, or even notifying an officer that I have a weapon. I carry myself as a professional. I also smile and act more friendly to reduce stereotypes. I also let people know I was in the military — but with today’s shooters having military backgrounds, it’s an even bigger red flag. I carry to protect myself and my loved ones. I am not going to run into a gunfight. I will think twice before reacting. But if I am there and someone is threatened, I will do what it takes for their protection. — Michael Anderson, 35, Las Vegas. Gun owner for three years. I am a gun owner and, as a law enforcement officer, carry one for work. I am fully aware that me carrying a gun legally is an anomaly, especially in the state I live in. I have noticed people doing a double take. When I walk in a gun store there is a certain level of extra scrutiny, as it is with most minorities, black or brown. I dare not have my weapon be seen by accident. I am sure it will cause a stir. — Kyle Doheny, 36, California. Gun owner for 11 years. I’ve had two good experiences thus far in Texas. Both times I let the officer know I had a gun. The first separated the magazine and locked it in the open position. The other didn’t do that, but did advise me to get my concealed carry [permit]. I haven’t received any hostile reactions, but I make sure to tell them immediately and try to moderate my voice because. I keep my hands on the steering wheel, and try not to make any sudden movements. You never know what sort of officer you’ll get when you’re pulled over. — Tracey Carrera, 31, Denton, Tex. Gun owner for two years. My only negative experience was with a local sheriff about four years ago. It was an encounter at a traffic checkpoint. When I notified the officer that I was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, he immediately waved off the other cars, pulled me over and then proceeded to twist my left arm forcefully to disarm me while I was sitting in the car. I honestly thought he was going to shoot me with my own weapon trying to get it out of my holster. He retreated to his vehicle and ran my registration and weapon. When all came back clean, he issued me a traffic warning and asked why I had ammunition. I refused to answer, and he warned me that had I resisted, I would have had a bad day. I now fear the police more than the bad guy. — S.L. Jordan, 49, Tampa, Fla. Gun owner for 28 years. I moved to Pocatello, Idaho, (a place where guns are very popular) from St. Louis, Mo., about eight years ago. I decided to purchase a firearm so that my 2-year-old son can learn to treat firearms with respect and know that they aren’t a toy. The older white gentleman behind the counter folded his arms when I approached and asked about purchasing a rifle. He asked what I was using it for. I told him target practice and as a learning tool to teach my son to respect firearms. It kind of caught him by surprise and he visibly relaxed a bit. He explained that sometimes they get folks who are angry at their spouses, and he was required to make sure I wasn’t. I am a black male in my 30s, I love wearing hoodies and am slightly overweight. There are still occasionally people who think “thug” when they see me, of course. But since purchasing the gun, I’ve experienced a sense of camaraderie with a lot of conservatives who are deep in gun culture. — Andrew Casey, 32, Pocatello, Idaho. Gun owner for two years. At times, I’ve felt out of place when I’m one of the few people of color at shooting events or gun shows, but I’ve also been heartened to see other Americans of African descent and people of color there. People have been welcoming and willing to share information. But sometimes I get questions. “Why do you need a gun?” “You’re ready to vote for Trump now, aren’t you?” The Second Amendment is for everyone. I am the “good guy with a gun.” I’m just like you. — L. Kenton Dunn, 40, Charlotte, N.C. Gun owner for two years. I am black and transgender. Being black (or any minority) and a gun owner can be described thus: On one hand, you’re told that you’re oppressed and that the country does not look after your interests. On the other, it’s said that if you decide to defend yourself, it will backfire. I tend to not discuss guns with fellow liberals anymore. They have shown they lack the capacity to discuss the issue with integrity, maturity and nuance. — Naomi Daniels, 33, Houston. Gun owner for two years. Despite being a lawyer, I am routinely mistaken for a criminal. Police officers who I have revealed my gun to have displayed great trepidation despite my handing them my concealed-carry permit along with my driver’s license. Law-abiding black people are just as motivated to defend themselves, their families and their homes as any other racial group. The right to bear arms has played a vital role in the lives of blacks for generations, and it will continue to do so. — Damon D. Colbert, 42, Alexandria, Va. Gun owner for 18 years. A man broke into our house when I was a child, and my father, a sheriff’s deputy, chased him out with his firearm. My father then sat outside in his car all night to protect us. Later, the police were looking for a black man who did not resemble my father in any way. The officer saw my father sitting in his car by our house and figured he had his man. My father ended up with a concealed weapons charge. and he could no longer get a job in his field. Despite this, my father instilled the importance of the Second Amendment. It may cause issues for black men, but at least we have the right to protect ourselves from America. — Darian Jabari Flowers, 28, Fresno, Calif. Gun owner for 10 years. My mother owned a gun and so did my father and brothers. In 1973, my father was murdered and, in a remarkably similar fashion, one of my brothers was killed in the early ‘90s. Several years ago, in the wake of a highly publicized mass shooting, I gave up my gun. However, a few months ago, I had cause to be concerned about my personal safety. It was a difficult choice to buy a gun. I polled my closest friends and family, who knew what I was going through. Some agreed with my choice, some did not. As an African-American woman, not a day goes by that I don’t think about how possessing a firearm could endanger my life. Should I be involved in an incident during which I draw or fire my gun, I know that I will immediately become the suspect. I am absolutely mindful of that, and it was a part of my decision-making process. Even if you do everything right, you could be signing your own death warrant. — Goldie Taylor, 50, Atlanta. Gun owner for two months. Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified Damon D. Colbert’s area of legal practice. He is now a criminal trial lawyer and is no longer a corporate lawyer.

378,"""Learn To Let Go"" might just be the name of Kesha's latest single, but it's also become her slogan over the past few years. Upon releasing the music video, the singer wrote about what the powerful anthem means to her in Huff Post, explaining the process of writing the song and creating the visuals—similar to her essay about previous tracks in Lenny Letter and Rolling Stone.  ""As much as our past creates who we are, we can’t let it define us or hold us back. And especially if you’ve been through something hard, and we all have, you can’t hold on to resentment because it’s like a poison,"" Kesha wrote in Huff Post, hinting at the sexual abuse claims and legal battle with producer Dr. Luke that has dominated headlines over the years. ""You have to learn to let go of those bad feelings and move forward."" She explained that the song was written with her mother, Pebe Sebert, and their writer's block dissipated with the help of a friend.  ""I know some of the hard times she has been through, and I was inspired by how she didn’t let any of the darkness from her past creep into her life,"" Kesha explained. ""Her beautiful spirit inspired me to consider how, even though we all go through tough things in our lives, we all have the ability to make the decision to just let it go and move forward. If my friend can do it, then I thought maybe I can do it too.""  ""I know I'm always like / Telling everybody you don't gotta be a victim . Life ain't always fair, but hell is living in resentment / Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you,"" she sings on the song, later explaining on the track that she now sees maybe there's a reason she's been ""through hell and back.""   The video is a nostalgic and whimsical recreation of old home videos, an intentional move that Kesha employed to reconnect to her ""childlike innocence."" ""I’ve looked at this record, Rainbow, as me being myself, Kesha Rose Sebert, my name without the dollar sign, genuinely for the first time ever. I mean that on every level but especially musically ― and that’s really scary for me,"" Kesha wrote. ""This idea of learning to let the negative things go has been extremely helpful for me over the last few years, and I hope it resonates with others."" You can read her full essay here.

381,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman’s Pershing Square Holdings has lost 19.9 percent in the first two months of 2016 as two of the hedge fund’s most prominent bets moved in the wrong direction in recent days, a person familiar with the returns said on Tuesday. Ackman, one of the industry’s most widely watched investors, told clients that his Pershing Square Holdings dropped 9.8 percent in February. Losses for the first eight weeks of 2016 are now nearly as high as they were for all of 2015, when the fund lost 20.5 percent. While the fund had a string of strong days earlier in the month, it suffered blows in recent days. Late last week Herbalife Ltd., in which Ackman has a $1 billion bet that its shares will fall, said in a filing that it was discussing a “potential resolution” of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. That sent the shares surging about 27 percent on Friday. Ackman first accused Herbalife of running a pyramid scheme in 2012, an allegation the company denies, and he has asked regulators, including the FTC, to investigate. He has said that he would make money on the bet if the share price drops to the mid-$30 range. It closed at $56.41 on Tuesday, having climbed some 17 percent in the last month. The second blow came when Valeant Pharmaceuticals, in which Ackman has been invested for roughly a year, disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company, sending its shares tumbling on Monday. The company also canceled a planned earnings call and said its chief executive, Michael Pearson, who had been on an extended medical leave, had returned over the weekend. The stock price has fallen 22.9 percent in the last five days. The moves were particularly painful because Ackman runs a very concentrated portfolio and invests in only a few companies at a time. Most fund managers are still tallying their returns and some have indicated they benefited as the stock market rebounded last month. Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Dan Grebler"

383,"WASHINGTON — “Busy day planned in New York,” President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Twitter on Friday morning, two days after his astonishing victory. “Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!” If anything, that understates the gravity of the personnel choices Mr. Trump and his transition team are weighing. Rarely in the history of the American presidency has the exercise of choosing people to fill jobs had such a far-reaching impact on the nature and priorities of an incoming administration. Unlike most new presidents, Mr. Trump comes into office with no elective-office experience, no coherent political agenda and no bulging binder of policy proposals. And he has left a trail of inflammatory, often contradictory, statements on issues from immigration and race to terrorism and geopolitics. In such a chaotic environment, serving a president who is in many ways a tabula rasa, the appointees to key White House jobs like chief of staff and cabinet posts like secretary of state, defense secretary and Treasury secretary could wield outsize influence. Their selection will help determine whether the Trump administration governs like the firebrand Mr. Trump was on the campaign trail or the pragmatist he often appears to be behind closed doors. “A new president is really vulnerable and open to all sorts of influence by strong-willed advisers,” said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. “Trump’s appointments over the next six weeks will be very significant because they can show whether he wants to create some unity in the country, or whether he really intends to deliver on his ideas.” One of the influences on Mr. Trump could come from an unlikely quarter: President Obama. Meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he looked forward “to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.” A day later, in interviews with The Wall Street Journal and “60 Minutes,’’ he said he had decided to retain elements of Mr. Obama’s landmark health care law after their conversation — a hint, at least, that he might govern less radically than he had campaigned. White House officials expressed hope that Mr. Obama would be able to impress on Mr. Trump the importance of other parts of his legacy, like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. The two will have the kind of peer-to-peer relationship that only fellow presidents can have — something that administration officials hope will appeal to Mr. Trump’s pride, as well as his desire to succeed, and make him view Mr. Obama less as a rival. They conceded, though, that there was little historical precedent for such a relationship, especially when the incoming president had ousted the incumbent’s party after such an acrid campaign, and that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama were never likely to become buddies. Mr. Trump is drawing mainly from a pool of trusted aides and supporters, according to people familiar with the campaign. On Friday, he named three of his grown children — Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric — as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to his transition team, an arrangement that rang alarm bells in Washington because they will also manage his businesses. The Trump family, it is clear, will wield unusual power in the composition of an administration that is already shaping up as remarkable for its clannishness. Even within Mr. Trump’s tight circle, however, there are sharp differences in ideology, background and temperament that could play out in how the White House deals with Congress and how the United States deals with the rest of the world. Perhaps the deepest schism is between Stephen K. Bannon, the conservative provocateur and media entrepreneur who was Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, and Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman who came to terms with Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Both are on a short list for chief of staff, according to people close to the campaign, and whoever is chosen, the other is likely to get another senior White House post. Each would bring a radically different approach to a job often called the second-most powerful in Washington — gatekeeper to the president and often the first and last person he sees in the Oval Office. Mr. Bannon, the executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart News and onetime Goldman Sachs executive, is an avowed enemy of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. An anti-establishment verbal bomb thrower with ties to the alt-right movement, Mr. Bannon may have little interest in compromising with the Republican-controlled Congress under its current leadership. He is an unabashed critic of the current immigration system and repeatedly encouraged Mr. Trump to appeal to the party’s base in the closing days of the campaign with arguments against globalization. Mr. Priebus, a party loyalist who tried to reconcile Republican leaders with their renegade nominee, would most likely build bridges to Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders. A Washington insider with a reputation for being easy to work with, Mr. Priebus would operate a more traditional White House, though given Mr. Trump’s flamboyant personality, traditional is a relative term. In some ways, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Priebus are proxies for the larger battle over what kind of president Mr. Trump will be. Some former Republican officials held out hope that Mr. Trump would be receptive to moderating influences, but others worried that he would simply listen to the last person he spoke to. “You always have that tension between what he said to get elected and what he actually believes,” said John D. Negroponte, a former director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush. “How selective will his amnesia be?” Mr. Negroponte, a Republican who supported Hillary Clinton in the campaign, said he could imagine senior members of Mr. Trump’s National Security Council warning him about the dangers of “cutting loose countries from our nuclear umbrella,” which Mr. Trump threatened during the campaign to do in reference to Japan and South Korea. But there could be a parallel battle for Mr. Trump’s soul in foreign policy. Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a retired career intelligence officer who is Mr. Trump’s closest foreign-policy adviser, is a candidate for national security adviser, according to an internal transition document obtained by the conservative news site The Daily Caller, as is Stephen J. Hadley, who served in that capacity for Mr. Bush. Mr. Hadley, who might also be considered for defense secretary, pushed Mr. Bush to undertake the troop surge in Iraq and is closely identified with the military interventionism of that administration. A key figure in the Republican foreign-policy establishment, Mr. Hadley had a hand in Mr. Bush’s second inaugural address, in which he called for the United States to be an evangelist in spreading democracy — something Mr. Trump has flatly rejected. General Flynn, a registered Democrat, has criticized the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration for leading the United States into quagmires like Iraq. “They’ve gotten us into mess after mess for the wrong reasons,” he said, echoing Mr. Trump’s harsh criticism of Mr. Bush during the Republican debates. And like Mr. Trump, General Flynn is withering about the foreign-policy establishment of both parties. It may seem counterintuitive for Mr. Trump to recruit a Bush administration veteran. But Peter D. Feaver, who worked on President Bush’s national security council and now teaches at Duke University, pointed out that Mr. Obama had campaigned “vociferously against the Iraq surge, and then asked the architect of the surge” — Robert M. Gates — “to stay.” Mr. Gates, as defense secretary, later persuaded Mr. Obama to deploy a similar surge in Afghanistan. “You can say one thing in campaigns, and mean it,” Mr. Feaver said, “and in personnel matters, do the opposite.” The contest for top economic posts does not expose the same ideological fault lines as those for the White House or national security jobs. But it does raise red flags, given the anti-establishment, anti-Wall Street sentiment that Mr. Trump stoked during the campaign. Several of the candidates on his short list for Treasury secretary come from Wall Street, including Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner who was the finance chairman of Mr. Trump’s campaign, and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. People close to Mr. Dimon said he was not interested in the job. Another candidate is a conservative Texas congressman, Jeb Hensarling, who has called for the repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, the banking regulations passed after the financial crisis, during Mr. Obama’s first term. The least predictable source of influence on Mr. Trump remains Mr. Obama. For all their differences, and the bitter words they flung at each other during the campaign, the two share traits. Both won the presidency as outsiders, and both hold their party’s foreign-policy establishment in contempt. With Mr. Trump lacking elective-office experience or the political coterie that accompanies establishment candidates to Washington, administration officials said Mr. Obama would probably spend more time with him than was typical for other incoming and outgoing presidents. And Mr. Trump, some outsiders predicted, would respect the advice of a president 15 years younger, whose path to the White House was nearly as improbable as his. “If you’re looking at things from a hiring point of view, as Trump does, Obama could have done anything he wanted,” Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University, said in reference to Mr. Obama’s career options. “That has to impress Trump.”"

386," (CNN)British teens with the highest test scores are less likely to smoke cigarettes yet more likely to drink alcohol and smoke pot compared with teens with lower scores, according to a study published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal Open. Although some people believe smart students simply have a tendency to experiment, James Williams and Gareth Hagger-Johnson, co-authors of the new study, say these patterns of substance use may continue into adulthood. ""Our research provides evidence against the theory that these teens give up as they grow up,"" said the authors, both affiliated with University College London.  Why young people use alcohol and pot In the decade ending in 2014, England saw a decrease in the percentage of 14-year-olds who admitted smoking and drinking. In 2004, 12% of 14-year-olds surveyed said they smoked cigarettes regularly, 23% said they drank alcohol at least weekly, and 17% had tried cannabis. Ten years later, the figures were 4%, 6% and 9%, respectively. In the United Kingdom, the drinking age is 18, though teens who are 16 or 17 and accompanied by an adult can drink (but not buy) beer, wine or cider with a meal.  The news was good overall, but why certain teens use drugs remains unclear. Wanting to understand more, Williams and Hagger-Johnson surveyed more than 6,000 students from public and private schools across England. Using questionnaires, they regularly tracked each student's use of tobacco, alcohol and cannabis from age 13 or 14 until age 19 or 20. Williams and Hagger-Johnson used national test scores taken at age 11 to rank students academically.  Some of their results provided no surprises.  During their early teens, high-scoring pupils were less likely to smoke cigarettes and more likely to drink alcohol than their peers with lower test scores. At this time, they were slightly more likely to say they used cannabis.  During their late teens, pupils with the highest scores were more than twice as likely to drink alcohol regularly compared with others, yet they also showed themselves to have less of a tendency to binge-drink. During this same period in their lives, the academically gifted students proved nearly twice as likely to use cannabis persistently and 50% more likely to use it occasionally compared with their peers with lower test scores.  One ""potential explanation,"" Williams and Hagger-Johnson said, is that ""higher-ability adolescents are more open to try cannabis but are initially cautious of illegal substances in early adolescence as they are more aware of the immediate and long-term repercussions that breaking the law might incur."" ""Cognitive ability is also associated with openness to new experiences and higher levels of boredom due to a lack of mental stimulation in school,"" the co-authors added.  Another possibility: Clever teens may ingratiate themselves and be accepted by older peers who ""facilitate access to alcohol and cannabis,"" they said. Finally, drinking patterns may be related to ""parental influence, since parents with high cognitive ability and socioeconomic status are known to drink alcohol more regularly,"" Williams and Hagger-Johnson said. Meanwhile, average students were 25% more likely to use cannabis on occasion and 53% more likely to use it persistently in their early teens than pupils they outperformed on tests. Average-ability students also used weed more than lower scoring peers.  ""Smoking cigarettes, drinking too much alcohol and smoking cannabis are widely accepted to be detrimental to your health,"" Williams and Hagger-Johnson said. Possible health effects include lung cancer, cirrhosis of the liver and psychiatric illnesses. Dependence or addiction is another possible consequence, but it's not just your health that may be affected. Another possible fallout for those who venture too deeply into ""light"" drugs is worse education and employment opportunities.  Results 'not entirely surprising' ""The cigarette smoking findings are consistent with the literature (students with lower academic standing being more likely to smoke),"" Pat Aloise-Young, a psychologist and associate professor at Colorado State University, wrote in an email. The alcohol results, though, are a ""mixed bag,"" she said. Although in England, the findings indicate that drinking is higher for students with higher academic standing, in the United States, researchers typically find the opposite result in high school but the same result for college-age teens: That is, American college students consume more alcohol than their non-college peers, she explained.  ""So these results are somewhat inconsistent with previous results; however, they are not entirely surprising,"" Aloise-Young said, since teens ""have different views of smokers and drinkers.""  ""There is an important caveat, however,"" she said. The new study indicates that students with lower academic standing have higher levels of hazardous drinking, and this ""is very important,"" despite the fact that the study authors do not focus on it.  ""From a public health perspective, hazardous drinking is more likely to result in negative consequences such as driving while intoxicated, alcohol-related crimes and injuries and unwanted sexual encounters,"" Aloise-Young said. According to Dolores Cimini, a psychologist and assistant director for prevention and program evaluation at the University at Albany's substance abuse counseling center, ""a strength of the study was that it was conducted on a very large sample of young people."" However, the fact that the study relied on self-reports and interviews means there might be issues ""related to accuracy of recollections.""  Cimini noted that recent studies conducted in the United States also note declining trends in substance use among teens. However, there's still cause for concern since several studies indicate a relationship between substance use during the late teens and education. The effects of excessive drinking and/or drug use tend to ""accumulate over time,"" she said. ""Initially, disengagement related to substance use is manifested by spending less time studying and skipping classes,"" Cimini said. ""As students become more disengaged ... the likelihood of earning lower grades, 'stopping out' or dropping out of college increases.""  Add to that possible health effects: problems with short-term memory, other brain functions and sleep patterns caused by excessive drinking; or marijuana-related effects such as attention and concentration difficulties and decreased information processing abilities. All of these may ""undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of study time"" leading to lower grades, Cimini said. Teen substance use can cheat students of a good education and negatively affect their lives, she said. According to Dr. Amir Levine, a psychiatrist and assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center, it's necessary ""to differentiate between substance experimentation and problem drug use."" Still, he finds the results ""interesting."" ""We usually think about youth who are not doing well in school as the ones that are prone to alcohol and drug use,"" Levine said; the new study tells us ""it may not be so simple."" "
387,"(Reuters) - The new coronavirus epidemic has claimed its first big M&A deal, with Macau casino operator Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (MLCO.O) pulling the plug on a stake purchase in Australia’s Crown Resorts Ltd (CWN.AX), citing a plunge in traveler numbers and casino closures. Macau, the world’s biggest gambling hub, has ordered casino operators to suspend operations for two weeks in a bid to limit the spread of the virus - a decision analysts say is likely to lead to months of cashflow bleed across the industry. A slew of flight cancellations due to the virus has hit tourism in the region while the closure of stores and factories is also pounding business activity in China, a key source of international gamblers. The developments were seen as the last straw for Melco’s planned purchase of a second 9.99% stake in Crown from billionaire James Packer. The total planned acquisition of a 19.99% holding was valued at A$1.76 billion ($1.2 billion) when it was announced last May. Even before the virus, the deal had raised regulatory concerns over links with Stanley Ho, father of Melco owner Lawrence Ho. Stanley Ho was previously under investigation by authorities in Australia and the United States for possible ties to organized crime. Then in August, Packer froze the sale of the second tranche pending an investigation into alleged criminal activity at Crown’s Australian operations. “Any further acquisition of Crown would have likely been a bigger bite than Melco could reasonably handle. The reining in of what was beginning to look like an empire build should be looked on favorably by Melco shareholders,” said Vitaly Umansky, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong. Melco also shelved plans for a seat on Crown’s board and analysts said it is likely to divest its current 9.99% holding in the future. Blaming the epidemic, which has killed more than 630, for its decision, Melco said in a statement it wants to focus on its core investments. Melco makes around 90% of its revenue in Macau, which has confirmed 10 cases of infection. It also has operations in Manila and Cyprus and is vying for a casino license in Japan, which executives are touting as the biggest market outside of Macau in Asia. Crown, which reports half-yearly earnings on Feb. 19, unveiled a major management shake-up last month which included filling its chief executive post that had been vacant for about three years. Its shares ended flat on Friday. Reporting by Farah Master in Hong Kong and Nikhil Kurian Nainan in Bengaluru; Editing by Edwina Gibbs"

389," Less than a decade after it began its program to deploy geothermal energy on a massive scale, China now has the largest amount of geothermal district heating of any country in the world, providing a cleaner, more environmentally friendly way to heat communities and to mitigate the poor air quality that results from burning coal. The big picture: First used in Idaho in the 1890s, geothermal works by recovering heat naturally stored in the earth. Unlike wind or solar, it provides a consistent, efficient and nearly emissions-free level of energy production when used for heating. While China and other countries push forward with geothermal technology, the U.S. lags far behind, meeting barely 0.01% of our heating demand with it. Background: In recent decades, the U.S. has begun using wind and solar resources to substitute for coal- and gas-fired electricity generation, and to use biofuels in place of gasoline and diesel oil. These new technologies are important, but a completely low-carbon energy-system transformation should also include geothermal energy, especially since a fifth of the primary energy the U.S. consumes annually is for heating homes and water, and comes mainly from burning fossil fuels. Many countries are already successfully taking advantage of geothermal district heating’s possibilities.  Iceland has almost completely shifted its energy dependency from fossil fuels to renewables in less than 50 years by using the country’s high-grade geothermal resources to meet about 95% of heating needs.  In France, more than 750,000 people now rely on geothermal heat.  There are 240 geothermal district heating systems in 14 countries in Europe.   The opportunity: In the U.S., indigenous geothermal resources are well distributed and abundantly available at the right temperatures for heating buildings and water. Developing geothermal resources for district heating now would provide the U.S. with a viable and sustainable long-term replacement for fossil fuels.

391,"LYNN HAVEN, Fla. — Mayor Margo Anderson drove through the neighborhoods of her small bayside city on Sunday to deliver some unwelcome news: The electric power knocked out nearly a week ago by Hurricane Michael might not be restored for two months. Behind the wheel of a black golf cart, she made the rounds as shellshocked neighbors emerged from houses with busted windows and walls and front porches, the damage from the punches of fast wind, rushing waters and toppled trees. “Just about every tree is down,” said Ms. Anderson, a fifth-generation citizen who was elected mayor of Lynn Haven, Fla., three years ago. “The power lines are destroyed. The transformers are destroyed. The power grid is destroyed. We have to start over.” That is the dire reality in the necklace of rural towns and coastal communities across northwest Florida that Michael gutted. Residents already reeling from the storm’s unexpectedly brutal winds now face the prospect of spending weeks relying on generators burning expensive fuel, or depending on aid from emergency workers. Ms. Anderson’s grim prediction of two months of darkness might be a bit pessimistic. Gulf Power, the main utility in the area, estimated on Sunday that electricity would be restored in Lynn Haven, downtown Panama City and neighboring communities by Oct. 24, two weeks after the hurricane made landfall. But Duke Energy, which serves another hard-hit swath of the Florida Panhandle, including Bay County and some parts of Gulf County, said it could not yet estimate how long it might take to get the lights back on in those areas. “I just want to be realistic and warn people that for a while, it’s going to be pretty primitive living,” Ms. Anderson said. Some 371,000 customers were still without electricity in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia on Sunday afternoon, according to the Edison Electric Institute, while more than 2.3 million customers who lost power in the storm have had it restored. The majority of customers still suffering from Michael-related blackouts — about 182,000 — were in Florida, according to the state’s emergency response team. About 2,000 people remained in storm shelters on Sunday, and the storm’s confirmed national death toll rose to 19. The power situation is worst in the Florida counties directly in the northward path traced by Michael’s destructive eye: 99 percent of customers remained in the dark on Sunday in Gulf County, 98 percent in Calhoun County and 91 percent in Jackson County. Neighboring counties were nearly as badly off. “It’s almost like a huge bulldozer went down the middle of Panama City and straight up through,” said Jeff Rogers, a Gulf Power spokesman. “This is kind of the Super Bowl of all big storms.” In Blountstown, the city manager, Traci Hall, said the city had 40 linemen working 16 hours a day, but even so, the municipal power grid would take weeks to piece back together. “It’s a total rebuild of our system,” she said. “Almost every single light pole in this city is on the ground. There is hardly any wires left hanging, period.” The city is in the process of getting the poles, cables and other supplies that its municipal electric utility needs so crews can keep working at full speed, Ms. Hall said. In the meantime, she has advised residents to prepare to be in the dark for 30 days. “I think everybody’s pretty much staying put at this point,” Ms. Hall said. “There are many, many that do not have a generator and can’t afford to purchase a generator. But I think that neighbors are going to help neighbors.” The biggest municipal utility in the storm-affected area is in Tallahassee, the state capital, which was spared the worst of the hurricane. But given the city’s dense tree cover, 96 percent of customers lost power anyway. Eighty-six percent had service restored by Sunday afternoon, according to Amy Zubaly, executive director of the Florida Municipal Electric Association, which includes five public utilities affected by Michael. In the Panama City region, amid destruction on almost every street corner, residents on Sunday continued to wait in long lines for hot food, bottled water, gasoline and prepaid cellphones that might get better reception than their own. The army of utility trucks in the area showed the scale of the recovery work underway, but they also clogged the region’s damaged roads. Tony McClean, a cook at a Panama City restaurant, said the storm pounded his rental house with such ferocity that a pine tree punctured the roof, its jagged remains hovering over his bed. “Hard not to look at that and not think about what would have happened to me if I hadn’t gone to a friend’s house at the last minute,” said Mr. McClean, 40. At first, he said, he thought about trying to live among the shredded remains, but with no running water and no power in the house, it did not make sense. Then he got the idea to try camping, something he had never done. He figured he could ride his trusty five-speed bike and set up on some quiet patch of the city. “I figure I can stay with friends for a few nights, maybe hit the shelter, then I will be on my own,” he said. “Everything is gone. I am on zero. If you haven’t gone through something like this, I don’t think people understand how bad it is.” In Lynn Haven, over the roar of chain saws, Mayor Anderson told residents living in a cluster of homes on the city’s east side to prepare for a long haul. She estimated that more than half of the city’s roughly 20,000 residents do not have generators. Or, in some cases, they have one that does not work. Starlia Jackson, 56, spent Sunday afternoon huddled outside her camper with her dogs, Romeo and Pooh. The old camper rocked from side to side during the storm’s afternoon assault but survived in the driveway of her late mother’s one-story brick house. The house took in water and wind after the French doors in the back shattered, so now the camper is home. People waiting in the many lines scattered throughout the region at grocery stores and gas stations are seeking water, ice, fuel and other essentials. Since the storm, Ms. Jackson has lived on strawberry soda, canned tuna and bottled water. The camper has a stove, but Ms. Jackson is low on propane gas, and on money to buy more. The house has a generator, but it is sitting broken on a tarp in the driveway. She cannot take her two pets with her to a shelter, so for now she plans to stay, dragging a grill she has not used in years next to the camper. “No power for possibly two months? Are you serious?” she asked. “I have no idea what I am going to do for that kind of time. You survive a storm, and then there is all the stuff that comes afterward that can be just as devastating.” Wanda Grigsby stepped among the downed trees and limbs to find a cleared spot to stand in her yard. She stood in the brutal heat wearing shorts, a T-shirt and rubber boots. Hurricane Michael had brought her to tears: It ripped off chunks of her house’s roof and dumped an impossibly thick layer of pink insulation all over the kitchen, living room and den. Even if she cleaned it up, the power will not be coming back soon, and neither will the running water that relies on it. “I have my 6-year-old grandson with me — no way can we do this,” said Ms. Grigsby, 54, who used to own a day care center and now is a caretaker for her mother. “I am going to stay with family in Jacksonville for a while.” At one point, Ms. Anderson eyed a large white Federal Emergency Management Agency vehicle that had arrived at a parking lot just behind the city’s heavily damaged police station. The lot had become an outdoor community center of sorts, where one of the local dentists was grilling hamburgers and hot dogs, and residents could pick up free bottled water, diapers, canned goods and dog food. Ms. Anderson jumped out of the golf cart and moved a portable street barrier to allow the FEMA bus into the lot. “You have no idea how happy this makes me,” she said. “People need relief.”"

393,"Actor Jon Voight on Tuesday endorsed Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpPossible GOP challenger says Trump doesn't doesn't deserve reelection, but would vote for him over Democrat O'Rourke: Trump driving global, U.S. economy into recession Manchin: Trump has 'golden opportunity' on gun reforms MORE, arguing that everyday Americans must unite behind the GOP presidential front-runner against the political establishment. “He’s got people attacking him from every side,” he said, according to Breitbart. ""It’s not right — as if Trump were a danger to our country. “He’s a patriot, and the people are responding because they know it’s exactly what has to happen,” Voight continued. ""Somebody has got to get in there and clean it out — even take the paint off. “There are a ton of lies, propaganda and slander, and it is very disturbing. And the American people are saying, ‘Hey, this is nonsense.' They are on his side now. And they’re right to be.” Voight, who has regularly backed GOP candidates in recent presidential election cycles, argued that Trump presents the GOP a chance of resolving voter exasperation with years of legislative gridlock. “He’s an answer to our problems, [and] we need to get behind him,” he said. ""The Republicans need to unite behind this man. “We need somebody to go in and reconstruct us in a sort of way, get us back to where we were [and] who we need to be,” Voight added. “[Americans] see his quality, and they feel the frustration of having put people in the Senate, and put into the Congress, whom they expected to be able to stand up to this [President] Obama onslaught against our Constitution, depleting our country in so many ways, in almost every area.” Voight added that he disliked 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s harsh criticism of Trump launched last week. Voight endorsed Romney in the 2012 election. “We felt so great about his family, we put [Romney’s] picture on our refrigerators and so on, and now he turns around and does this, which is so way out of line,” he said of the former Republican governor of Massachusetts. ""We need a guy who has the guts to stand up and just say what has to be said ... [Americans] see this playing out in front of them, and that’s it.” Romney has recently become one of Trump’s most vocal detractors, arguing he lacks the political consistency and temperament necessary for the presidency. Trump has countered that Romney failed conservatives by unsuccessfully challenging Obama during the 2012 presidential election. View the discussion thread.

394,"When leaders of the Baltic States returned to the White House on April 3, 2018, it marked the third visit by leaders of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania; previous heads of state gathered in Washington in 1998 and 2013. As it was before, the purpose of their visit was to secure American protection from Russia for their tiny countries. They probably left disappointed. President Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE told Kersti Kaljulaid of Estonia, Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania and Raimonds Vejonis of Latvia that he wants better relations with Russia. “Nobody has been tougher on Russia,” said the American president. For the future, however, Mr. Trump told the assembled leaders that improved ties “would be a good thing, not a bad thing.” He implied that Baltic concerns were misplaced. “Just about everybody agrees to that, except very stupid people, OK?” he asked rhetorically.    Faced with a resurgent Russia, the Baltics again have turned to the West for military and ideological support. There are good reasons, however, that the United States should not have involved itself in the defense of these countries. They were part of the Soviet Union for over a half-century, which allowed many residents to develop an affinity for Russia. One-third of the population of Latvia and one-quarter of Estonians consider themselves ethnically Russian.   Russians in these countries are not entitled to automatic citizenship and must pass a rigorous naturalization process. This leaves most Russians “stateless,” a condition that makes Moscow’s promises of citizenship and passports look attractive.  Russia beams radio and television broadcasts into the countries, depicting their governments in the worst light. The Kremlin subsidizes Russian ethnic groups and political parties in all three states. Russian oligarchs own many of the industries. The countries face pressure from Moscow in the energy sector. Lithuania gets all its oil and natural gas from Russia, and Latvia receives the majority of its energy from the same source. Only Estonia has its own supply of shale oil, and ports to bring non-Russian oil into the country by sea.   The Baltics are under threat. According to Lithuanian Army Lt. Col. Algimantas Misiunas, Russian plans to seize the Baltics are more than a wish or desire, but a need. Russia needs a land bridge with Kaliningrad, full access and control of the Baltic Sea, and the restoration of its Soviet-era influence in Europe. Independent Baltic States stand in the way of all these goals.  These are all strong arguments against getting involved in the Baltics, and they should have been made in 2003. Conditions changed in 2004 when NATO admitted the Baltics into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As such, the three countries joined a military grouping that Russian National Security Strategy identified as a threat to Russian national security: “The strengthening of Russia is taking place against a backdrop of new threats to national security that are of a multifarious and interconnected nature ... (including) opposition from the United States and its allies.” The  Baltics, then, are under greater threat than ever — because of their association with the United States. Since the 2004 accession to NATO, the United States and its allies have been the guarantors of Baltic security because of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that “... an armed attack against one or more of (the parties) in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.” This is the centerpiece of the alliance and, should these countries be abandoned in the face of Russian aggression, it would mean the collapse of the alliance. For this reason, since 2014 the United States rotated troops throughout the Baltic States. Today, the Americans have been replaced by the United Kingdom in Estonia, Canada in Latvia, and Germany in Lithuania.      Writing for the Army War College, a variety of military authors advocate increasing the NATO military presence through more ground troops (permanently stationed or rotated), air assets and coastal defense forces. None of these measures makes sense from a military viewpoint.  Geopolitically, the area is squeezed between Russia and Belarus on the East, and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad in the West. There is no strategic depth, and the states are only connected to Europe by the 65-kilometer-wide Suwalki Gap. The entire area is covered by Russian Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities. It would be suicide to try to fight a war with the Kremlin on this territory. The United States and NATO are committed to the defense of three countries whose combined population is roughly equal to the population of the Washington, D.C. area and whose alliance with the West is a threat to Russian national security interests. The West has dealt itself a bad hand. If the West were to abandon the Baltics, however, the Russian threat would move to Poland and beyond while the NATO alliance was fractured. NATO and America can protect the Balkans only through the projection of steadfast resolve.  The deployment of token NATO troops combined with surge exercises are insufficient to stop a Russian advance, but they serve as a warning that an attack on the Baltics is an attack on the entire alliance. It is Western unity, combined with the American nuclear umbrella, that can keep the Kremlin from the shores of the Gulf of Riga.    James J.

395,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors fled bonds at the fastest pace since 2013 in the final week of October, worried about rising interest rates and tightening monetary policy, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday. More than $18.5 billion of mutual fund and exchange-traded fund assets flowed out the debt market during the week ended Oct. 31, the most since the “Taper Tantrum” panic of June 2013, when markets worried about the U.S. Federal Reserve planning to stop buying bonds. Fed policy has again helped drive investors to reconsider their bond holdings after pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into debt products since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The latest withdrawals marked a fourth straight week of outflows, according to the trade group. U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers seem on course to deliver their fourth rate hike of the year in December - the most in any calendar year since 2006 - while letting the Fed’s large holdings of bonds accumulated during the financial crisis roll off. “When rates rise from a very low level, bond yields and stocks can go up at the same time,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co’s funds business. Investors added the most cash in six weeks - $5.6 billion - to stock funds during the same week as strong quarterly earnings reports rolled in, ICI said. Year-over-year profit growth for the S&P 500 is at 27.7 percent, with most companies beating Wall Street forecasts, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

397,"Airbus has agreed in principle to a settlement with French, British and U.S. authorities over an investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption, it said on Tuesday. The European planemaker has been investigated by French and British authorities for suspected corruption over jet sales dating back over a decade. It has also faced U.S. investigations over suspected violations of export controls. Airbus, which dominates with U.S. rival Boeing the commercial airliner market, said it could not comment on precise details regarding its talks with authorities, including how much it expected to pay out in the settlements. Some press reports suggested a figure of around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion). Nevertheless, Airbus shares rose, as analysts and traders welcomed the fact that Airbus was managing to draw a line under the affair. The stock was up 2.3% in early trading. ""Airbus confirms that it has reached agreement in principle with the French Parquet National Financier (PNF), the U.K. Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the U.S. authorities,"" the Franco-German company said in a statement. ""These agreements are made in the context of investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption as well as compliance with the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (""ITAR""). They remain subject to approval by French and UK courts and the U.S. court and regulator,"" it said. Analysts at brokerage Jefferies welcomed the settlement, although they wrote in a note to clients that the reported cost of 3 billion euros was ""towards the upper end of what we thought probable."" A traders' note from Bank of America (BofA) said the settlement removed a negative ""overhang"" on the stock. Airbus had already fired more than 100 people over ethics and compliance issues as a result of its own probe into the corruption allegations. The investigations by British and French authorities began after Airbus drew the attention of regulators to inaccurate declarations it had made to Britain's export credit finance agency over payments to sales agents. The SFO launched its probe in August 2016, followed seven months later by the PNF. At the center of the case was a decades-old system of third-party agents or intermediaries run from a now-disbanded headquarters unit which at its height involved some 250 people across parts of the world and several hundreds of millions of euros of payments a year, sources familiar with the matter have said. A German probe into Airbus for potential misuse of client documents is ongoing."
398,"Long-hitting American Dustin Johnson, seeking major redemption after several near-misses in recent years, won the 116th U.S. Open on Sunday amid high drama and initial uncertainty over his victory margin. In pursuit of his first grand slam crown, the world number six played clutch golf under intense pressure at brutally difficult Oakmont Country Club, finishing in style as he sank a short birdie putt at the last. Having negotiated the final seven holes under notice that he might be penalised for a rules infraction on the fifth green, despite being cleared by another official at the time, he was docked a shot after the round's completion, with his score amended to a closing 69 for a four-under winning total of 276. After sinking the final putt to clinch his 10th PGA Tour victory, Johnson pumped his right fist in delight, and then lifted his putter to acknowledge the loud roars from the crowd before being embraced by his caddie. ""Feels good, feels really good, feels well deserved,"" an emotional Johnson said after finishing three shots in front of fellow Americans Jim Furyk (66) and Scott Piercy (69), and Ireland's Shane Lowry (76). Lowry had been four ahead after the weather-delayed third round was completed earlier on Sunday but he struggled in the conditions while piling up seven bogeys. ""I've had a lot of opportunities that I didn't quite get done, so this one's definitely really sweet,"" said Johnson. ""I knew I was swinging well, and I just kept thinking, it's just me and the course. ""I'm playing against the course. I can't control what anyone else does. So I just tried to hit golf shots, tried to hit it on the correct side of the hole, and two-putt."" The rules controversy was sparked when Johnson's ball moved slightly as the American was preparing to attempt his par putt at the fifth hole, shortly after his birdie attempt there from five feet broke left and slid past the cup. He denied having caused the movement and the official accompanying the pairing decided not to levy a penalty. After being informed on the 12th tee by a U.S. Golf Association official that he might be penalised after the round, Johnson ran up a three-putt bogey at the 14th but otherwise displayed nerves of steel as he negotiated the closing stretch. He rolled in a 10-footer to save par at the 16th and thunderous roars of ""DJ, DJ, DJ"" rang out as the crowd gave vocal support to the tournament leader in his bid for a first major victory after a series of heartbreaks in the past. Johnson had previously recorded 11 top-10s in the majors without winning, including two-runner-up spots, and he missed a three-foot putt at the final hole to hand last year's U.S. Open at Chambers Bay to Jordan Spieth. On Sunday, however, Johnson was remarkably composed in the circumstances and made several clutch putts on a day when the entire field struggled on greens running lightning-fast. ""After last year, to come back and perform like this, I think it shows what kind of golfer I am,"" said the 31-year-old. ""I've knocked on the door a bunch of times. To finally get that major win, it's huge."" American world number two Spieth finished a disappointing title defense with a 75 for a nine-over total of 289.

400,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare insurer Cigna Corp said on Wednesday it will continue to offer individual coverage under Obamacare for now while rival Anthem Inc announced it was shrinking its participation, amid uncertainty over the fate of the government-subsidized program. Wednesday was the deadline for insurers to submit to the government their 2018 rates for individual plans sold on the HealthCare.gov website set up by former President Barack Obama’s 2010 healthcare restructuring. Cigna said it was keeping the option to stay in the seven states where it now sells plans, but that it would wait to make a final decision on its participation depending on how possible market changes shake out. “We have worked very hard to be part of the solution here even in the face of a lot of withdrawals in the marketplace. We’ve stayed in a focused way,” Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said in an interview after the company met with investors. Cigna has about 350,000 members in individual plans. “If you get the right collaborative relationships up and running with physician groups and hospital groups like we have in Missouri, you can generate a better result, not a stellar result, but a better result,” he said. Cordani said Cigna is losing money on the plans. President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress have vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, arguing the law had boosted the cost of coverage and placed too much of a burden on businesses. They have also threatened to cut off the subsidies that make the plans affordable for many consumers as soon as this year. The House of Representatives has passed a bill to gut Obamacare and the Senate is expected to unveil its draft on Thursday. Cigna’s final decision on whether to continue participating in Obamacare next year will be made before the government’s late September deadline after more is known about anticipated new rules and regulations, Cordani said. Meanwhile, Anthem said in a statement it would mostly stop selling individual plans in Wisconsin and Indiana, exiting the Obamacare exchanges altogether and cutting out sales through brokers in all but one county in Wisconsin and five counties in Indiana. Anthem, the largest U.S. health insurer with Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states including New York and California, had already said it would leave the Obamacare-related market in all but one county in Ohio. Other large health insurers have also pulled out for 2018, including Aetna Inc and Humana Inc “Planning and pricing for ACA-compliant health plans has become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations,” Anthem spokeswoman Leslie Porras said. Oscar Health, a small health insurer that has only been in a handful of states, said it was boosting its participation in Obamacare by adding plans in Tennessee and Ohio.

With a guest list of more than 1 million people for the 15th birthday party, BBC reports, Mexican police are expected to deploy to the bash for security reasons. Such a huge turnout would easily dwarf the extravagance of any ridiculously expensive Super Sweet 16 party on MTV. In the video invite, 14-year-old Rubi Ibarra Garcia stands smiling in a cheetah-print dress and tiara, as her father opens the December party to everyone who can come. ""Hereby everyone is cordially invited,"" Rube's father, Crescencio Ibarra, says to the camera. Well, it appears more than a million people have taken that message to heart.

The company uses a software-as-a-service approach to make it as seamless as possible to crawl your website and give you insights into your search engine optimization strategy. Yet, Botify isn’t about making optimizations for you. Instead, it gives you data so that you can make optimizations. Botify is a sort of analytics tool to back your SEO assumptions with tangible numbers. Currently, the company has more than 300 customers, such as Expedia, BlaBlaCar, Farfetch and eBay. The startup has three different components. First, Botify developed a server-based crawler. You don’t have to run anything on your machine; Botify will take care of it from its servers. The company then gives you an overview of your website’s structure. Then, Botify also tells you more information about Google’s or Bing’s indexing crawlers. The company knows which page was crawled by search engines. Finally, Botify gives you a complete dashboard with detailed reports about your SEO strategy. There are two things that make Botify stand out. Botify targets big companies that rely heavily on search engine traffic — e-commerce, transportation, media, etc. Bringing more traffic to these websites is a great way to create new customers. In other words, improving SEO isn’t just something nice to do, it’s a good way to generate purchases. That’s why Botify is an easy sell. Anything that can improve a company’s bottom line is a good thing. And then, there’s the recurring pricing model. Botify costs between $569 and $999 per month. With 300 customers already, you can see that the startup has a healthy business model. Let’s hope that clients don’t just sign up for a few months, fix their SEO and unsubscribe. But new features should bring more value to existing customers."
405,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission urged a federal judge on Wednesday to appoint a trustee to manage the Woodbridge Group of Companies, a bankrupt property developer the regulator accused of being a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. Woodbridge filed for bankruptcy in December and weeks later the SEC sued to freeze its assets, accusing it of selling unregistered securities to raise funds to repay earlier investors. The regulator has said investors are owed more than $961 million, and has alleged the company’s owner, Robert Shapiro, used at least $21 million for private jets, luxury cars, wine and political donations. Shapiro has denied the allegations. Larry Perkins, who was hired as a chief restructuring officer in October, said the company is investigating the allegations. More than 40 lawyers attended the U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday as creditors, investors and authorities sought to protect their interest in the company assets, including the Owlwood estate in Los Angeles once owned by singer Cher. The SEC and an official creditors committee wants an independent trustee, while the company and lawyers for some investors argued for sticking with Perkins. The judge, Kevin Carey, said in similar situations he has benefited from having an independent examiner. “My concern was if there were improprieties I want to hear about them publicly rather than have them buried in settlements,” he said. Carey continued the hearings until Jan. 18. Perkins was grilled on Wednesday about deals worth millions of dollars to Shapiro that Perkins said were necessary to convince Shapiro to cede management of Woodbridge prior to the bankruptcy. Shapiro also contributed property to the company. Beginning in 2012, Woodbridge raised about $1.2 billion from 8,400 investors, many of them senior citizens, through the sale of securities that promised interest of up to 8 percent, according to a federal complaint by SEC. Woodbridge told investors the funds would be loaned to commercial property developers for up to 15 percent interest, according to the SEC. The company also said it was investing in high-end property. In reality, the developers that were borrowing from Woodbridge were actually entities controlled by Shapiro, according to the SEC. Woodbridge skirted scrutiny by avoiding licensed broker-dealers and instead distributing its securities through insurance agents and unregistered investment advisers, incentivized with large commissions, according to the SEC. The company also sold securities through seminars and television advertising, the SEC said. Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Del.; Editing by Matthew Lewis"
406," (CNN)Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, delivered the following prepared statement prior to Robert Mueller's testimony. Read it in full below. At the outset and on behalf of my colleagues, I want to thank you, Special Counsel Mueller, for a lifetime of service to the country. Your report, for those who have taken the time to study it, is methodical and it is devastating, for it tells the story of a foreign adversary's sweeping and systematic intervention in a close U.S. presidential election. That should be enough to deserve the attention of every American, as you well point out. But your report tells another story as well. For the story of the 2016 presidential election is also a story about disloyalty to country, about greed, and about lies. Your investigation determined that the Trump campaign -- including Trump himself -- knew that a foreign power was intervening in our election and welcomed it, built Russian meddling into their strategy, and used it. Disloyalty to country. Those are strong words, but how else are we to describe a presidential campaign which did not inform the authorities of a foreign offer of dirt on their opponent, which did not publicly shun it, or turn it away, but which instead invited it, encouraged it, and made full use of it? That disloyalty may not have been criminal. Constrained by uncooperative witnesses, the destruction of documents and the use of encrypted communications, your team was not able to establish each of the elements of the crime of conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, so not a provable crime, in any event. But, I think, maybe, something worse. A crime is the violation of a law written by Congress. But disloyalty to country violates the very obligation of citizenship, our devotion to a core principle on which our nation was founded, that we, the people, not some foreign power that wishes us ill, we decide, who shall govern, us. This also a story about money, about greed and corruption, about the leadership of a campaign willing to compromise the nation's interest not only to win, but to make money at the same time. About a campaign chairman indebted to pro-Russian interests who tried to use his position to clear his debts and make millions. About a national security advisor using his position to make money from still other foreign interests. And about a candidate trying to make more money than all of them, through a real estate project that to him, was worth a fortune, hundreds of millions of dollars, and the realization of a lifelong ambition -- a Trump Tower in the heart of Moscow. A candidate who, in fact, viewed his whole campaign as the greatest infomercial in history. Donald Trump and his senior staff were not alone in their desire to use the election to make money. For Russia, too, there was a powerful financial motive. Putin wanted relief from U.S. economic sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and over human rights violations. The secret Trump Tower meeting between the Russians and senior campaign officials was about sanctions. The secret conversations between Flynn and the Russian ambassador were about sanctions. Trump and his team wanted more money for themselves, and the Russians wanted more money for themselves, and for their oligarchs. But the story doesn't end here either. For your report also tells a story about lies. Lots of lies. Lies about a gleaming tower in Moscow and lies about talks with the Kremlin. Lies about the firing of FBI Director James Comey, and lies about efforts to fire you, Mr. Mueller, and lies to cover it up. Lies about secret negotiations with the Russians over sanctions and lies about Wikileaks. Lies about polling data and lies about hush money payments. Lies about meetings in the Seychelles to set up secret back channels, and lies about a secret meeting in New York Trump Tower. Lies to the FBI, lies to your staff, and lies to our Committee. And lies to obstruct an investigation into the most serious attack on our democracy by a foreign power in our history. That is where your report ends, Mr. Mueller, with a scheme to cover up, obstruct and deceive every bit as systematic and pervasive as the Russian disinformation campaign itself, but far more pernicious since this rot came from within. Even now, after 448 pages in two volumes, the deception continues. The President and his acolytes say your report found no collusion, though your report explicitly declined to address that question, since collusion can involve both criminal and non-criminal conduct. Your report laid out multiple offers of Russian help to the Trump campaign, the campaign's acceptance of that help, and overt acts in furtherance of Russian help. To most Americans, that is the very definition of collusion, whether it is a crime or not. They say your report found no evidence of obstruction, though you outline numerous actions by the President intended to obstruct the investigation. They say the President has been fully exonerated, though you specifically declare you could not exonerate him. In fact, they say your whole investigation was nothing more than a witch hunt, that the Russians didn't interfere in our election, that it's all a terrible hoax. The real crime, they say, is not that the Russians intervened to help Donald Trump, but that the FBI had the temerity to investigate it when they did. But worst of all, worse than all the lies and the greed, is the disloyalty to country, for that too, continues. When asked, if the Russians intervene again, will you take their help, Mr. President? Why not, was the essence of his answer. Everyone does it. No, Mr. President, they don't. Not in the America envisioned by Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton. Not for those who believe in the idea that Lincoln labored until his dying day to preserve, the idea animating our great national experiment, so unique then, so precious still — that our government is chosen by our people, through our franchise, and not by some hostile foreign power. This is what is at stake. Our next election, and the one after that, for generations to come. Our democracy. This is why your work matters, Mr. Mueller. This is why our investigation matters. To bring these dangers to light. "
407,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China “expect to make more headway” in trade talks this week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday as the top U.S. business lobbying group said differences over an enforcement mechanism and the removal of U.S. tariffs were still obstacles to a deal. “We expect to make more headway. I can’t report any of the details, but it’s a larger, grander discussion than anything we’ve had before in U.S.-China trade relations, and there’s a certain amount of optimism,” Kudlow said in remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Kudlow, who directs the White House National Economic Council, acknowledged that there are still issues to be resolved, and the Trump administration will focus heavily on ways to hold China to keep its reform promises and curbing intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers and lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to resume talks with Chinese vice premier Liu He on Wednesday, just days after the two sides reported progress in talks last week in Beijing. The Chamber, the largest and most influential business lobbying group, sees increasing chances that Washington and Beijing will reach a deal to end a nine-month tariff war. “We’re getting to the point where it’s clear that both governments want a deal,” Myron Brilliant, the Chamber’s head of international affairs, told reporters. “The presidents want a deal, and they need to get through the end-game issues. This is a critical week.” The United States and China have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of two-way trade since July 2018, raising costs, disrupting supply chains and roiling global markets. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is pressuring Beijing to meet a long list of demands that would rewrite the terms of trade between the two countries, including changes to China’s policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers. Trump on Tuesday afternoon repeated his now-familiar refrain that China trade talks were going “very well” as he met with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House. Absent significant process this week on the “tricky” issues of tariffs and enforcement, the goal to complete a deal this month may be missed, Brilliant said. The Trump administration and American companies want structural IP and market economy issues addressed, with a way to ensure China follows through on its promises, Brilliant said. U.S. officials favor tariffs as a way to maintain leverage on China and ensure those obligations are met. But it is unlikely that China would agree to an enforcement mechanism that included re-imposition of unilateral U.S. tariffs without the current tariffs being removed, Brilliant said. The continued threat of tariffs hanging over commerce would mean a deal would not end the risk of investing in businesses or assets that have been affected by the trade war.

409,"LONDON (Reuters) - When the pound plunged this month on new worries about Brexit, New Yorkers Derek Hotter and Ian Clark hopped on a plane for an impromptu holiday in Britain. Record numbers of dollar-, yuan- and euro-rich tourists eager to snatch a bargain could be a silver lining after the sharp decline in sterling since Britain voted to leave the European Union on June 23. The vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. The pound has fallen 28 cents since the night of the vote, dropping to $1.2215 GBP=D4 on Tuesday. Britain saw tourist numbers rise in July, with visits up 2 percent from the same month last year to 3.8 million. “We’ve done a bunch of shopping,” Hotter, who is in digital marketing, told Reuters in London’s Piccadilly Circus. “I was here a couple of years ago and it was a little harder spending and now you come over here knowing it’s so much better in our favor, you feel like you can shop a little bit more.” Americans last year spent 3 billion pounds in Britain, making them the most important tourists for the United Kingdom. “In a period post-referendum, post-Brexit this is the shining star industry that is benefiting from, amongst other things, a weakening of the pound,” said Christopher Rodrigues, chairman of the British Tourism Authority. He said the weak pound is an attraction for Chinese visitors, but the marketing focus for pulling in more of China’s 100 million who travel overseas is more long term.     “We need to keep going at that market because the real tidal wave of Chinese visitors is going to be probably five to ten years from now when the market has got a lot bigger,” he said.     Bookings from China to Britain are up by nearly 25 percent between now and Christmas, with the lure of London’s luxury quarter attracting many. “Exchange rate you know, it’s lower than before,” said one Chinese woman explaining why her mother chose this month to visit.     “Many discounts here. Especially for Chinese customers I think,” said another excited shopper.     Even though continental European visitors do shorter stays and spend less money than their American counterparts, they are important. Visit Britain predicts a rush of European visitors in the coming months.     “I think we are going to have a real crush in the sales this Christmas, because I think there are going to be a lot of Europeans here and Brits will have to get their trainers on to get ahead of the line - but that’s great news for us,” said Rodrigues.

410,"Sept 9 (Reuters) - The American Medical Association (AMA) on Monday urged people to avoid the use of e-cigarette products across the United States until health officials could further investigate and understand the cause of lung illnesses across the country. ""In light of increasing reports of e-cigarette-associated lung illnesses across the country, the AMA urges the public to avoid the use of e-cigarette products ...,"" AMA President Patrice Harris said in a statement. At least five people in the United States have died from a lung illness possibly tied to vaping.

E-cigarettes are generally thought to be safer than traditional cigarettes, which kill up to half of all lifetime users, according to the World Health Organization. But the long-term health effects of vaping are largely unknown. ""We must not stand by while e-cigarettes continue to go unregulated.

411,"Medium has reinvented itself many times over, but one facet of its identity seems to be sticking: it's becoming the writing platform of choice for billionaires, billionaire politicians, and anti-billionaire politicians alike. On Friday, senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren published a blog post on Medium with her plan to break up Big Tech, including Facebook, Google, and Amazon. Gotta love the use of a tech platform to call out the tech industry. But this wasn't the first time eyeballs flocked to Medium for a major — if slightly more salacious — announcement. In February, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos chose Medium to make his bombshell announcement that the National Enquirer was trying to blackmail him with dick pics, and that he was not afraid!  Medium user and vest enthusiast Jeff Bezos. As CEO of Amazon, Bezos will likely be at odds with Warren for years to come. But at least they're united in their love of Medium. This is truly the Medium electionhttps://t.co/sE6NWG7XuQ — SteadmanTM (@AsteadWesley) March 8, 2019 Another Warren adversary used Medium for a big announcement of his own. Presidential hopeful and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz published a post on Medium defending his decision to run for president, essentially issuing a ""screw the haters"" message. Evan Williams, a former Twitter CEO and creator of a popular mid-aughts blogging platform, Blogger, founded Medium in 2012 as an alternative way for people to share and discover ideas online. Based in San Francisco, but with operations in both San Francisco and New York, it attracted 60 million monthly readers in 2017, when it launched its subscription service. It unveiled four subscription publications in 2019. Medium has a hybrid model as both a place where anyone can post things for free (a platform) and a news outlet (a publisher). This inspired Recode to call it a “Platisher” in 2014, declaring, ""A new generation of media companies is experimenting with opening their content-management systems to outsiders.""  Hey Howie. That hybrid model has led to some missteps. Medium's publisher efforts have launched, shut down, and re-launched several times, with layoffs and shutdowns in both 2015 and 2017, and the most recent re-launch currently underway. Medium allows users to publish for free and pays editorial staffers and freelance writers. BuzzFeed has a somewhat similar model, which came under fire after layoffs and the discovery that one of its most popular content creators was an unpaid teenager responsible for 700 viral quizzes.  This year, along with its new editorial publications, Medium become the hot place for high-profile personalities like Schultz, Bezos, and Warren to reach out to the public. Keep your eyes peeled, chances are we’ll see more big announcements on Medium soon.  "
412,"like a boss The author-illustrator behind ‘everyone’s a aliebn when ur a aliebn too’ is writing for TV and film, plus pursuing a Ph.D. at M.I.T. CreditCreditElizabeth Lippman for The New York Times In his orthographically freewheeling 2017 best seller “everyone’s a aliebn when ur a aliebn too,” the author-illustrator Jonny Sun explores the melancholia of life on Earth as seen through the eyes of an extraterrestrial. The inquisitive outsider, an alter ego birthed on Mr. Sun’s Twitter account, stumbles through heart-melting highs and lip-quivering lows, meeting such creatures as an owl plagued by impostor syndrome and an egg suffering from an existential crisis. Near the end of its “activitey log,” the alien concludes: “if u replace ‘i have to..’ with ‘i get to..’ then human life becoms AMAZIMG.” Lately, Mr. Sun has been able to say “I get to” about a lot. He collaborated with Lin-Manuel Miranda last year on “Gmorning, Gnight!”, a best-selling collection of inspirational messages, and he created an AI-powered interactive art installation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he’s a doctoral candidate. Mr. Sun, an emotionally transparent Canadian who is also a humorist, artist and screenwriter, is working on a screenplay for “Paper Lanterns,” a film for Fox Family and Chernin Entertainment. He’s also writing for Netflix’s animated series “BoJack Horseman,” prepping for a talk at the TED2019 conference in April and queuing up three new books per a recently announced deal with Harper Perennial. “I’m always interested in very personal, kind of quirky, kind of sad and kind of funny stories about what it means to be a person,” he told me. “The ‘aliebn’ book was the first crystallized version of just one way to talk about that type of stuff. Right now, I’m in the process of stretching and pulling and seeing what other ways those ideas can be explored.” I caught Mr. Sun, 29, in early March, as he patronized virtually every coffee shop in Los Angeles and prepared to head to the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex. 9 a.m. Make coffee and work on a new draft of my TED Talk. For me, it’s tough to distill and trim things to fit a time limit. I’m sort of a hoarder, in real life and also when I write. I’m trying to cram in a lot of ideas, but given that it’s a 10- or 12-minute talk, it has to be a lot simpler and more straightforward. I send it off to my TED curator — who acts as editor, mentor and emotional support — in advance of our call tomorrow. 1 p.m. I meet a friend at Document Coffee Bar in Koreatown to write, now focusing on my “BoJack” episode. A normal week is working from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the writers’ room, but this is a little bit of an unusual week. 3 p.m. Call with Susan Benesch. We created the M.I.T. Online Humor Conversation Series together. We discuss what we’re going to talk about in our South by Southwest panel, “Online Humor in Difficult Times,” with the comedian Jaboukie Young-White. 8 p.m. Head to Balcony Coffee and Tea in Koreatown to work. I’m still new to L.A. and have been trying to explore different neighborhoods by writing in their coffee shops. I usually will get an iced matcha (Americano-style or with sparkling yuzu if available), a regular drip coffee with cream and sugar or a flat white if I’m feeling fancy. 11 a.m. I have a call with my TED curator to discuss my latest effort. We both think it’s not where it should be and agree to scrap that draft and approach the talk from a different angle. 1 p.m. Meet a friend for lunch at Triniti in Echo Park. The thing that helped me really fall in love so quickly with L.A. was the food. In a weird way, it sort of reminds me of home, which is Toronto: they both have such a great food scene that doesn’t get talked about enough. 3 p.m. I have a call with an exec at Chernin to discuss the first act of “Paper Lanterns,” which I sent over a couple weeks ago. But I won’t be able to get back to writing that screenplay until after I finish writing my episode of “BoJack.” It takes me a little bit of mental ramp-up to be able to switch between these two different things. With “BoJack,” I’m working with eight other writers in a room, a group collaboration where I’m the one piecing all the ideas together. With the screenplay, it seems personal; more independent and quiet. But I think I actually like both of those modes. 8 p.m. I’ve been working hard so I treat myself to an izakaya dinner at Tsubaki. It’s almost embarrassing how much I eat out. 9:30 p.m. Go home and talk to my fiancée over the phone. We’re doing long distance for a little stretch, so we talk every night when we’re apart. 9 a.m. I have to go into the “BoJack” offices for a meeting today. I also have my weekly phone call with my therapist. It takes about 45 minutes to walk to work from where I’m living, and it’s nice to walk and talk to him. 12 p.m. Work on my episode all day at Coffee for Sasquatch on Melrose. I’m definitely a headphones-on person in coffee shops, but sometimes I forget to even play music. I think part of me just likes the feeling of having headphones in; it’s like I’m preventing things from escaping out of my ears. When I do listen, lately my go-to writing music has been “A Seat at the Table” by Solange, Nina Simone and Mahalia. When I’m outlining and need more excitement, it’s “Acid Rap” and “Coloring Book” by Chance the Rapper, anything Janelle Monae, Tierra Whack, Raveena and Prince. 5 p.m. Haircut, in advance of South by Southwest. 10 a.m. My episode is due at noon tomorrow, so I work all day on it. I’m Postmates-ing food because it’s crunchtime, and I stay home and write. What I love about working on the last day of deadline is that it almost feels like everything else melts away. Having the deadline looming is almost like a clarifying thing for me. There’s always so much stuff that feels like it needs to get done, but on those days, it feels like everything falls away and it forces me to focus on the thing that is the most pressing. It’s a mixture of both peacefulness and stress. 4 a.m. Finished. 9 a.m. I have a call with my editor at Harper Perennial in the morning, where we talk about the batch of essays and ideas I sent her on Sunday. We go over what’s working, what isn’t and discuss ideas for ordering and structuring the book. It’s a collection of short pieces — small moments and discrete little things. For the most part right now, I’m in the process of writing them in disparate places. I’ll email some to myself, or write them down in a notebook or in my Notes app. It feels a lot like scrapbooking. I think it’s nice that I get to do that while I’m balancing a long-form screenplay that’s just one long story. 12 p.m. Pack for South by Southwest. 2 p.m. I go into the “BoJack” office. Raphael Bob-Waksberg, the creator and showrunner, and the writers have read my draft of the script, and they all discuss their notes with me. 4 p.m. I get a Lyft to the airport to catch my flight to Austin. During the ride, I take out my laptop — car office, woo-hoo! — and I review an audio recording from the notes session. I clarify and write comments on my script on what needs work and what needs to be edited, rewritten, moved around, etc. 6 p.m. Get to my gate. It’s three hours until we take off; I’ll spend the flight working on the new draft for my TED Talk and poking around at my episode notes. 9 a.m. From my room, I review a festival application for “The Laughing Room,” the M.I.T. installation, that will make up a central part of my Ph.D. dissertation. 11 a.m. Meet Susan to discuss the South by Southwest panel. 12:30 p.m. We go to an event called “We Tried to Tell Y’all: Black Twitter as a Source,” featuring activists and academics that I’m really excited to hear from: Feminista Jones, Dr. Meredith Clark, L. Joy Williams, Dr. Mia Moody-Ramirez. There are a few others that I wanted to go to (“We’re Here, We’re Queer and We’re Changing the Film World” and “How Media Fragmentation Fuels Online Toxicity”), but we skip those because we need to figure out our own panel. 5 p.m. Our talk starts. Having Jaboukie offer his insight is wonderful. I don’t think we get to hear enough from comedy people working online about how and why they’re doing what they’re doing. It’s cool to talk shop with him and get Susan’s perspective from a more academic standpoint. 6 p.m. I go to the after-party for the premiere of “Ramy,” a new Hulu show created by Ramy Youssef. I try to catch the screening of “Long Shot,” but the theater is full by the time I get there, so I go back to my hotel and work on my episode for a little bit, finish the new draft of my TED Talk, then crash. I try to do South by Southwest stuff but I’m overwhelmed and a bit burned out. Sometimes I am energized by big crowds, but this weekend they made me incredibly anxious and overwhelmed. Instead, I find a quiet corner of a hotel lobby near the festival and have coffee all day and work. It’s still close enough that I can people-watch and feel a part of South by Southwest. Interviews are conducted by email, text and phone, then condensed and edited."

414,"One juror accused other jurors of misconduct in the trial of the man convicted of killing Ms. Vetrano, whose body was found in a Queens park. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] It took only five hours for a jury to convict a Brooklyn man this month in the high-profile slaying of Karina Vetrano, whose badly beaten body was found partially clothed in a Queens park after she had gone out for a late-afternoon jog. Then one of the jurors in the case came forward to say he was improperly pressured to convict the defendant, Chanel Lewis, of first-degree murder and sexual abuse. Based on the juror’s sworn statement, Mr. Lewis’s defense lawyers accused other jurors of misconduct and asked the judge to throw out the verdict. On Monday, the judge rejected the request for a new trial after a highly unusual two-hour hearing in which three jurors testified about their deliberations. “Motion denied,” Justice Michael B. Aloise said, without explaining his reasoning. Mr. Lewis is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday morning. He faces life in prison without parole. He confessed to beating Ms. Vetrano, and traces of his DNA were found on her body. The defense argued his confession was coerced and the DNA evidence was unreliable. Christopher Gooley, the juror who had come forward, said he was the final holdout against finding Mr. Lewis guilty and had accused other jurors of violating the judge’s orders not to discuss the case before deliberations. He said that on the second day of the trial, after Ms. Vetrano’s parents had testified, the foreman told him that his mind was made up. In an interview, Mr. Gooley said he had deep misgivings about the verdict and still harbors doubts about Mr. Lewis’s guilt. He spoke to The New York Times on Saturday, and the newspaper granted him anonymity until his name was revealed in open court. “This is bigger than Chanel Lewis,” he said on Saturday. “I’m standing up to the system. Showing people what the inside of a jury room is really like.” The allegations were an unexpected coda in a case that had already become embroiled in a broader debate over police conduct in the investigation into the killing of Ms. Vetrano, 30, in August 2016. The first trial of Mr. Lewis ended in a hung jury in November, after some jurors agreed with the defense theory that the confession was false and the DNA evidence unreliable. Some of Mr. Lewis’s supporters have gone so far as to assert, without proof, that DNA evidence was planted in order to convict him. Mr. Lewis’s mother, Veta Lewis, has said her son was framed. She has vowed to appeal the verdict. In court papers filed by the Queens district attorney’s officer, six jurors either denied Mr. Gooley’s claims or said they did not recall the incidents he described. Two of them testified in court on Monday and said they did not see other jurors pressure Mr. Gooley. The lead prosecutor, Brad A. Leventhal, argued that the defense “had not made out any claim to disturb this good and valid and fair verdict.” Mr. Leventhal also suggested that Mr. Gooley was lying and that he was seeking “15 minutes of fame.” But Jenny Cheung, one of Mr. Lewis’s lawyers, argued that Mr. Gooley did not have a reason to lie. Most of his allegations had not been denied, she said, and his accounts to the news media were made anonymously, a move that is inconsistent with someone interested in fame, she said. Ms. Vetrano’s family have said they have no doubt of Mr. Lewis’s guilt. On Monday, her father, Philip Vetrano, called the defense’s request for a new trial “a joke.” “Nothing but fools,” he said. “All fools.” After the jury received the case on April 1, deliberations became contentious, Mr. Gooley said. He said he had doubts about Mr. Lewis’s guilt, but gave in to the other jurors because he believed that the judge was going to keep the jurors there well into the night until they delivered a guilty verdict. He said he was also dismayed about technical difficulties that prevented the jury from viewing Mr. Lewis’s videotaped confession. The two jurors said in court, however, that Mr. Gooley had decided after dinner that he did not need to see the confession again. When the jurors voted to convict Mr. Lewis, it was after 9 p.m. and they had been in the courthouse for about 12 hours. “I was getting flustered, having migraines, and they were serving food from a pizza joint — not the healthiest,” Mr. Gooley said. “I felt I needed to get out of there.” Mr. Gooley said he also felt subtly pressured by Justice Aloise to reach a guilty verdict. He said he noticed during the trial that the judge was wearing purple, which he learned was Ms. Vetrano’s favorite color, and he believed it was a deliberate show of solidarity with the victim’s family. The judge did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Gooley said he tried to send a note to the judge to find out how long the jury would have to stay that evening, but Brian Morrissey, the foreman, ripped up the message. Mr. Morrissey, in an affidavit, said he did not recall making any statements to Mr. Gooley about his opinion before deliberations, nor did he remember ripping up a note. Mr. Morrissey was not called to testify on Monday. Mr. Gooley said he told his fellow jurors that he did not believe prosecutors had proven Ms. Vetrano had been sexually abused, and noted the absence of DNA establishing that there had been such an attack. The jurors could convict on the first-degree murder charge only if they also found Mr. Lewis guilty of sexual abuse. Mr. Lewis’s lawyers said two jurors offered expert opinions about the sexual-abuse evidence based on their own experiences, including with other rape cases, which would have violated the judge’s instructions. But one of those jurors denied those claims on Monday, while the other acknowledged drawing a comparison between evidence in Mr. Lewis’s trial and another case, but said he dropped the subject at another juror’s request. On Aug. 2, 2016, Ms. Vetrano was killed as she was jogging in Spring Creek Park in the Howard Beach section of Queens. When investigators learned the DNA found on her body belonged to a black man, they sought samples from hundreds of black men who had been arrested in nearby parts of Queens and Brooklyn. Detectives focused on Mr. Lewis on the recommendation of a police lieutenant who had seen him on two occasions “acting suspiciously” in Howard Beach, a predominantly white neighborhood. Mr. Lewis lived three miles away in East New York, Brooklyn, with his mother and had graduated from a school for students with learning disabilities. The DNA taken from Mr. Lewis matched traces found on Ms. Vetrano’s neck and cellphone, and a mixture sample from two of her fingernails. Mr. Lewis initially denied killing Ms. Vetrano, but after 11 hours in police custody, he confessed in a videotaped interview to beating her. At times during the confession, he appeared confused and mumbled through some of his responses."
415,"LONDON (Reuters) - Trading in Neil Woodford’s 3.7 billion pound ($4.69 billion) Equity Income Fund may not be reopened swiftly after it was suspended on June 3 because of the illiquid assets it holds.  The fund’s authorized owner, Link Fund Solutions, must update investors on whether it intends to keep the fund closed to trading at least every 28 days. The first deadline is July 1.  The main reason trading was suspended was to allow time for the fund to sell its stakes in unlisted and illiquid assets. This is also the main factor determining when it can reopen.  Woodford had been trying to sell those stakes before the suspension. His plans included moving five holdings into his listed Woodford Patient Capital Trust (WPCT) in a March share swap. But redemptions outpaced that effort.  Britain’s markets regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said at the time of the suspension that a fifth of the fund’s assets were in such illiquid assets.   The illiquid assets include preference shares in four firms listed on the Guernsey stock exchange that have never traded.   FCA data show how difficult it will be to reopen the fund quickly, indicating that just 8% of the holdings could be sold in a week. The rest are expected to take much longer to sell.  The data showed selling 29% of the fund’s holdings could take up to a month, about 30% would require six months and another third would need from six months to more than a year.  “I doubt very much whether that fund will be unsuspended until much later this year, possibly not until next year,” said Chris Bailey, analyst at Raymond James.  Tracking Woodford’s handling of the process has been made harder since he stopped publishing a list of holdings on the company website.  A Woodford spokesman told Reuters on June 13 that the frozen fund had sold 100 million pounds in more liquid listed British stocks. He declined to offer an update when contacted on June 21.   According to the 2018 annual report, the fund had stakes in 24 unlisted or Guernsey-listed companies, excluding those subsequently removed in the share swap. The companies equated to 18.26% of the portfolio with a value of 850 million pounds, based on assets under management at the end of 2018.  The fund’s investment include stakes in 14 unlisted healthcare or biotechnology companies.  ($1 = 0.7895 pounds)  Additional reporting by Samantha Machado; Editing by Edmund Blair"
416,"(Reuters) - The Iowa Supreme Court on Friday granted an emergency temporary injunction halting a portion of a 20-week abortion ban that was signed into law by Republican Governor Terry Branstad just hours earlier. The law, passed by Iowa’s Republican-controlled House and Senate last month, bans abortions once a pregnancy reaches 20 weeks and stipulates a three-day waiting period before women can undergo any abortion. The law does not make exceptions for instances of rape or incest but does allow for abortions if the mother’s life or health is at risk. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Planned Parenthood, a group that provides family planning services, including abortions, challenged the waiting-period part of the legislation in court as well as the requirement for an additional clinical visit women must make before an abortion. The state Supreme Court on Friday issued the injunction after it was denied Thursday by a district judge. “We are pleased that the court granted the temporary injunction, ruling on the side of Iowa women who need access to, and have a constitutional right, to safe, legal abortion,” Suzanna de Baca, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland said in a statement. The state will have an opportunity to respond to the court’s decision on Monday. “This is all part of the process and we’re confident that the stay will be lifted very shortly,” said Ben Hammes, a spokesman for the Republican governor. Women in the United States have the right under the Constitution to end a pregnancy, but abortion opponents have pushed for tougher regulations, particularly in conservative states. There are 24 states that impose prohibitions on abortions after a certain number of weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive policy. Seventeen of these states ban abortion at about 20 weeks and after. Iowa’s law, Hammes said after the signing, marked a “return to a culture that once again respects human life.” In Tennessee, a bill similar to the Iowa measure was sent to the desk of that state’s Republican governor on Wednesday to possibly be signed into law.

417,"China has emerged as the most formidable challenge that has ever faced NATO. That is true as well for the North American and European economies upon which NATO rests, which account for roughly half of global GDP. Most media focused on the theatrics of this week's 70th anniversary summit of NATO's now-29 members. The biggest news – though woefully underreported – was that NATO, history's most enduring and successful alliance, for the first-time defined China as a strategic challenge. That news was drowned out by French leader Emmanuel Macron, who came into town having declared NATO brain dead; by Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who responded that it instead was the French leader's brain that was lifeless; by Canadian leader Justin Trudeau, who was caught mocking President Trump during allied cocktail hour; and by President Trump, who shrugged in response that the Canadian was two-faced. As entertaining as all that was, more significant was that NATO allies have belatedly focused on the most significant challenge to world democracies and their market-driven economies in our new era of major power competition. However, although the closing NATO summit statement required unanimity, even more revealing is the ambiguity of its language, reflecting disagreement over whether Beijing is more of an economic opportunity than fundamental challenge. ""We recognize that China's growing influence and international policies present both opportunities and challenges that we need to address together as an alliance,"" it said. That's soft stuff considering that this authoritarian, state capitalist country has already become a global center of gravity – the world's largest by population, ranking second only to the United States in military spending and, depending on what measure you like, is already or will soon be the largest economy on Earth. The language was also muted compared to new outrage and legislative action in the United States and elsewhere regarding the reported repression of China's Uighur Muslim minority, following weeks of Hong Kong protests and local elections supporting their cause, and in the face of continued concerns regarding Huawei's 5G telecom dominance. One also didn't have to look far in the news this week to see new evidence of China's growing partnerships with Russia, NATO's primary focus for many years, ranging from a new 1,800 mile-long gas pipeline connecting both countries, to Huawei's expanded relations with at least eight top Russian universities and research institutes. Writing for Defense One, the Atlantic Council's Barry Pavel and Ian Brzezinski have usefully called upon NATO to create a NATO-China Council that would collectively engage China on areas of concern. It would be a structural mechanism for dialogue with Russia to raise concerns, avoid misunderstandings and, where possible, foster cooperation. The list of matters it would deal with is already a lengthy one, write the authors: Huawei's targeting of European and North American digital infrastructure; increasing ownership of major European seaports critical to NATO; joint exercises with the Russian military, including in the Nordic-Baltic region; and cyber espionage and intellectual property theft. A London financier friend, who has enough business in China to remain anonymous, lays out the case for why democracies around the world need to get their act together soon to address [Beijing's] still-underestimated challenge. Over time, he argues, China will have the largest human, economic and technological resources of any single country. ""The government has more successfully fostered economic development in a strategic fashion than any other communist or totalitarian regime in history,"" he says, ""successfully managing the tension (so far) between central control and harnessing the power of capitalist and market-based incentives and structures. Rising per capita incomes and the power of compounding means it will become the largest economy on the planet. Period."" Nothing could be more confounding for those who thought history had determined that democratic rule was the flavor of the future. Unlike previous communist and authoritarian states, China has combined political control with innovation and development resulting from decentralized markets. In startling manner, China has managed to become a technological leader as well, and its closed system is feeding its advancement using big data and Artificial Intelligence. ""China has been smart about building strength without projecting strength,"" says my London financier friend. ""Many of its totalitarian predecessors lacked that discipline. And it will likely continue. It can further its rise until the discipline is no longer required."" At that point, he reckons it will all become about one thing: what is China's intent and how will it use its power. On this point, it would be unlikely to foster freedom of speech, dissent and discourse, rule of law, or democratic elections and decision making – everything NATO was created to defend. So, it then comes down to degrees and modes of conflict or competition, which is what a concerted Western strategy would be designed to discuss and steer. If you play the world forward, the resources still available to the US and its allies are formidable. They include the global financial system and the world's reserve currency, which is critical to maintain. The U.S. also has the world's most advanced innovation engine, though that's no longer secure. The NATO summit was also a good reminder of the value in pooled resources, not just for military purposes but perhaps more importantly to promote economic strength. However, at a time when unity of purpose is most required, new trade skirmishes broke out last week with Brazil, Argentina and with France. History may still force transatlantic allies together to better manage China's rise collectively. During the last world leadership transition, common Western purpose was less necessary because the US was displacing the United Kingdom, and both had similar value systems. As China rises, common purpose among Western allies will be more crucial. Hong Kong protests have been a useful reminder that human desire for freedom is universal. Pluralism and democracy have proven to be the most resilient systems over time. Yet even optimists have got to worry about the costs of mismanaging this period of history. It's a good thing that NATO called out the challenge this week. Now alliance leaders should replace mocking and name calling with strategic planning and purpose.

418,"May 21 (Reuters) - Mallinckrodt Plc filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and forecast an about 10% hit to annual net sales of its gel used to treat multiple sclerosis symptoms following changes to Medicaid rebate calculations, sending shares plunging as much as 34% on Tuesday. The drugmaker filed the lawsuit, which also named the health agency's Centers For Medicare And Medicaid Services division(CMS), after CMS changed how it calculated Medicaid discounts for the company's Acthar gel. Mallinckrodt said the change could result in a one-time charge of up to $600 million. Acthar Gel, which is used to treat infantile spasms and multiple sclerosis, brought in revenue of $1.11 billion in 2018, accounting for 35% of the company's total revenue. Mallinckrodt said CMS' decision could impede the company's efforts to develop new therapies for patients with fewest treatment options. CMS and HHS did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Medicaid program provides health coverage to low income Americans and is jointly paid for by the states and the federal government. The U.S. Justice Department last month joined a pair of whistleblower lawsuits alleging a drugmaker now owned by Mallinckrodt improperly promoted Acthar and paid kickbacks to doctors who prescribed the treatment. The company's shares were trading down about 30% at $9.31. (Reporting by Aakash Jagadeesh Babu in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"
419,"""Quite a few"" possible 2020 presidential hopefuls have already come knocking for money, according to Democratic donor Marc Lasry, co-founder of distressed asset specialist Avenue Capital. Lasry, who supported Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, refused to name names during a CNBC interview Tuesday. But he did say they were all politicians and none is from the business world. ""It's all the people you would think."" The billionaire investor stressed that Democrats need to have a message beyond ""anybody but Trump"" if they want to take the White House. Democrat John Kerry found out the same thing in 2004 — an ""anyone but Bush"" message was not enough to send incumbent Republican President George W. Bush packing, said Lasry, chairman and CEO of Avenue Capital, which has about $9.6 billion in assets under management. Lasry did, however, admit he's seen good returns since Trump became president, in a rally that continues to fuel records in the stock market. ""We've done well, thank God."" In Monday's powerful advance, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high, pushing the index to a nearly 17 percent gain since Election Day. In addition to running Avenue Capital, Lasry owns a stake in the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks. Lasry appeared in New York on ""Squawk Box"" ahead of participating in a 9 a.m. ET global investing panel at the day-long Delivering Alpha conference organized by CNBC and Institutional Investor magazine. — In addition to Lasry, Delivering Alpha participants include Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Omega Advisors Chairman Leon Cooperman, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, Blackstone chief Steve Schwarzman, DowDupont CEO Edward Breen, Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos and JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon."

421,"The digital coin industry is increasingly trying to find ways to curry favor with regulators on fundraisers known as initial coin offerings. ""We are starting to see the self-regulation of this market, I think the taming of the Wild West,"" said Marco Santori, head of fintech practice at Cooley and an advisor to the International Monetary Fund, told CNBC. Along with Juan Benet and Jesse Clayburgh of blockchain developer Protocol Labs, Santori released a whitepaper on Monday that lays out how certain initial coin offerings can avoid falling the designation of ""security."" Even in Switzerland, where financial authorities approved a private bank for bitcoin asset management, the Crypto Valley Association distributed Tuesday a paper by local lawyers to define three categories of tokens and four kinds of associated risks. Four of the five largest token sales on record are from Swiss-based companies, according to the release. Many blockchain-focused startups see initial coin offerings as an easier and cheaper way to raise money than going through traditional means such as finding venture capital. Global investors have poured the equivalent of $2.3 billion, into initial coin offerings, mostly in the last six months, according to CoinDesk. The rush of money into what are often very early-stage, failure-prone projects has prompted regulatory concern. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated in late July that national securities laws may apply to sales of new digital coins and warned investors of the risks of participating in the token sales. Many of those token sales are officially off-limits to U.S. residents out of fear that U.S. regulators will come after the founders in case the project fails. However, not all tokens are strictly coins like bitcoin that can be speculated upon. Instead, some tokens are meant to be used to access or interact with a new system, such as a decentralized cloud storage system. The paper Santori co-authored attempts to emphasize the distinction between utility and security tokens. The paper describes how a ""simple agreement for future tokens,"" or ""Saft,"" serves as an initial investment contract between a startup and accredited investors. That way, by the time the token launches publicly, the token is a usable part of a new system — clearly not an investment security. The SEC declined to comment to CNBC. Source: CoinDesk Others are working on a legal way to support digital coins that are meant to become securities. Last week, Overstock.com announced its majority-owned subsidiary tZero, along with financial services companies RenGen and Argon, are forming a joint venture to launch an SEC-compliant alternative trading system for trading digital coins issued in initial coin offerings. Overstock has a license for an alternative trading system through its acquisition of Pro Securities two years ago. ""The SEC needs to give more guidance ... because businesses crave more certainty and I think investors crave more certainty as well as protection,"" said Jonathan Johnson, a board member of Overstock.com and president of its blockchain-focused subsidiary Medici Ventures. That said, both the alternative trading system and ""Saft"" whitepaper emphasize the role of accredited investors and appear to contradict the coin offerings' goal of giving all investors early access. Typically, initial coin offerings give anyone with bitcoin, ethereum or whichever digital currency the fundraiser accepts the access to what may be the next bitcoin or internet system. But the little-regulated token sale process as it stands provides little protection for investors in case of fraud or loss. ""On the one side you are eliminating the people who are going to be users of the token,"" said Erik Syvertsen, general counsel at AngelList, and a consultant on the ""Saft"" project. On the other hand, ""people who have the income or net worth are better able to bear the risk."" The SEC on Friday alleged a businessman and his two companies were selling unregistered securities and charged them with defrauding investors in two initial coin offerings supposedly backed by real estate and diamonds. The U.S. is not the only country scrutinizing the token sales. China banned the initial coin offerings last month, sending bitcoin's price tumbling. South Korea also announced a ban on the token sales last week. Bitcoin mostly shrugged off the news and recovered Tuesday to around $4,300, according to CoinDesk."
422,"Uber announced today it took $3.5 billion from Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s main investment fund as part of its latest round. The new investment is the largest to date for the ridesharing giant and brings the total balance of both cash and debt to more than $11 billion but doesn’t increase the company’s current $62.5 billion value. Uber rules the U.S. market as the dominant ridesharing service and continues to forge ahead on global expansion and the Middle East is a key area in the company’s future. Uber also operates in surrounding Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and partners with those country’s government entities to hire and educate drivers. According to the company, there are more than 395,000 active riders in the region. “We appreciate the vote of confidence in our business as we continue to expand our global presence,” Uber founder Travis Kalanick said in a statement. “Our experience in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how Uber can benefit riders, drivers, and cities and we look forward to partnering to support their economic and social reforms.” According to the company, the investment aligns with Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia’s recently announced plans to reduce dependence on oil and oil-related industries. “This ambitious and far-reaching plan presents a number of goals, including unlocking strategic sectors such as tourism and entertainment, boosting employment opportunities and women’s participation in the workforce, and encouraging entrepreneurship,” PIF’s Yasir Al Ruymayyan said in a statement. However, the country has been criticized for not allowing women to drive and transportation is a huge problem for that half of the population. Saudi Arabia believes Uber offers a solution by supplying on-demand rides for women – Uber has been operating in the country since 2014 and says about 80 percent of all riders are female."
423,"Tor Project, the group behind the anonymous Tor browser, has released an alpha version of its own anonymous browser for Android. Following this release, Orfox, the longstanding Tor Project-approved browsing app for Android, said it will be sunset by 2019. To run both apps, users will need to also download the Tor Project proxy app, Orbot. Tor Project’s anonymous browser uses a system of decentralized relays that bounce a user’s data to anonymize internet activity. This makes it almost impossible for ads, location trackers and even government surveillance to follow your tracks across the web. While Tor is often associated with illegal drug or weapons sales on the dark web, the browser is also a haven for political dissidents, journalists and just browsers who prefer to maintain their anonymity. This release comes several days after Tor Project rolled out Tor Browser 8.0, based on Firefox’s 2017 Quantum browser structure. The major updates include a new user landing and on-boarding page, increased language support and improved bridging methods to enable users to access the browser in countries where Tor is banned — like Turkey. While the service is regarded as the current gold standard of anonymous browsing, there are still vulnerabilities. Federal investigators can gain access and identify users through security flaws in the browser itself. It remains to be seen how secure Firefox Quantum will be for Tor 8.0, but users would be wise to follow Tor’s guidelines on further protecting their anonymity, just in case."

429,"(Reuters Health) - - For some patients with chronic back pain, computerized phone therapy might work just as well at easing symptoms as in-person visits with a therapist, a small study suggests. The experiment focused on what’s known as interactive voice response technology, which works something like the computerized prompts people can encounter when they call a bank or insurance company. In this case, the prompts focused on back pain issues and guided patients to advice on symptom relief. Researchers randomly assigned 125 patients with chronic back pain to get ten weekly sessions of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), either in person or over the phone using interactive voice response (IVR). After three months, all of the patients experienced similar reductions in pain and improvements in things like physical functioning and sleep. “Technology-based forms of CBT, like CBT delivered via automated calls that we used in the trial, can be more accessible and convenient for people with chronic pain, as well as equally effective,” said lead study author Alicia Heapy of the VA Connecticut Healthcare System in West Haven. While previous studies have suggested computerized calls might work for back pain, the current study offers fresh evidence of its effectiveness relative to the current gold standard of in-person treatment with a therapist, Heapy said by email. “Making this comparison provides evidence for recommending it as an alternative to in-person treatment for people who are not able to regularly travel for in-person CBT sessions or who live in an area where there are no clinicians trained to deliver CBT for chronic pain, or for those who might prefer this approach as a matter of convenience,” Heapy said. Study participants were 58 years old on average and most of them were male. Half of them had been living with back pain for at least 11 years. All of them were VA patients, and only about 21 percent of them lived less than ten miles from their local VA facility. About 35 percent of them lived between 10 and 25 miles away, and another 44 percent had to travel even longer distances from home. At the start of the study, every participant received a manual explaining how cognitive behavior therapy can help with pain management and functioning in daily life even when pain persists. This approach focuses on helping people become more physically active, engage with activities they enjoy and pursue new things if those old activities aren’t possible. Researchers asked participants to rate their average pain levels over the previous week on a scale from 0 for no pain up to 10 for the worst pain imaginable. People rated their pain as about a 5.6 on average at the start of the study, indicating moderate pain. After treatment, both groups reported a similar average reduction in pain ratings of about 0.8, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine. Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t include a control group of people who received no therapy at all. More research is needed at additional locations and among different patient populations before drawing any broad conclusions about how well computerized therapy might work for back pain, the researchers also point out. “It’s probably too early to recommend this to patients since it’s not widely available yet,” said Daniel Cherkin of the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. “However, these results suggest that other existing online CBT or other mind-oriented programs for chronic pain might be worth trying,” Cherkin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. Even if more research suggests it’s effective, computerized voice technology still might not work for every patient with back pain, said Dr. Jatin Joshi, a pain and spine care researcher at Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York who wasn’t involved in the study. “Although online treatment is appealing for its convenience, there are certain psychological and medical conditions that need direct supervised medical management,” Joshi said by email. “It’s important that patients receive any care, on-line or in-person, under the supervision of a trained medical professional.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2oR7Ix6 JAMA Internal Medicine, online April 3, 2017."

431,"A senior Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) official under fire for his anonymous blog posts on racial discrimination will leave the agency by the end of the month, according to an internal email obtained by The Hill. Eric Blankenstein, CFPB policy associate director for supervision, enforcement, and fair lending, announced Wednesday that he will leave the bureau for “another position” in an internal email. Blankenstein said that his last day at the CFPB would likely be May 31, and did not elaborate on the new job he is taking outside of the bureau. A senior CFPB official told The Hill that “Eric informed leadership that he will be departing the Bureau in the coming weeks for another opportunity.” Blankenstein’s departure was first reported by Bloomberg Law. Blankenstein, a CFPB political appointee, set off an internal revolt at the bureau after the emergence of racially insensitive blog posts he authored in 2004, revealed by The Washington Post in September.

432,"(Reuters) - Apache Corp (APA.N) reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday as the U.S. oil and gas producer battled lower crude prices and a decline in output, and the company said it had begun reorganizing its operations to save costs. The reorganization, expected to save at least $150 million annually, began in late summer, and should be mostly completed by the end of the first quarter of 2020, the company said. RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold called the restructuring “significant”. U.S. shale players have struggled as oil prices CLc1 hovered around the mid-$50s in the September quarter, down more than 18% on average from a year earlier. Apache said its average price per barrel of oil fell 15.2%, while gas prices dropped 35.2% per thousand cubic feet in the third quarter. Total production dropped 5.4% to 450,644 barrels of oil equivalent per day, hit by temporary delays in its Permian operations which are expected to continue into the current quarter as well. Apache said it has reduced drilling activity at Alpine High, a region in West Texas, and deferred completion activity into next year, resulting in a 5% decrease in production from the region in the current quarter. Alpine High recently struggled with weak natural gas pricing, which prompted the company to temporarily halt production and say it would reassign capital to other areas if pricing did not recover. Apache said it would spend less on exploration and production next year, setting its capital budget at 10% to 20% below this year’s budget of $2.4 billion. The Houston-based company also expects modest growth in its oil production next year. The company's net loss attributable to shareholders came in at $170 million, or 45 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $81 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier. bit.ly/2BYHSjC Excluding items, it posted a loss of 29 cents per share, bigger than analysts’ average estimate of 19 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

435,"Imagine standing on a world 40 light-years from Earth. You look up, and see other planets slowing moving through the sky, sisters to the world you find yourself on.  You notice that it's relatively dark, because the star you're orbiting is dim, and far smaller than the sun. But you're still warm, thanks to the infrared light emitted by the ultracool dwarf star.  This could be a vision of what we'd see if we traveled to one of the seven Earth-sized planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1, a small, dim star about 235 trillion miles from our home.  The possibly icy, watery and steaming worlds of TRAPPIST-1. Thoughts of these newly-discovered planets outside of our solar system are enough to send even the most limited imagination wandering through the universe, right?  Proving that very point, a number of artists have already created their own art celebrating the distant worlds not too terribly far from Earth.  Two short stories, a graphic novel and a poem are now all live on trappist.one, a website updated by scientists on the team studying the star devoted to the star system.   Artist's impression of a view from the surface of a planet. ""As scientists, we thought that one way to communicate how excited we are about this new system, is to allow artist to imagine what it would like there,"" the intro to the stories section of the website says. ""Please enjoy these works keeping in mind that those are mostly works of fiction, written with artistic licence!"" One of the short stories, called ""La Oportunidad,"" and written by Adam Burgasser is about the emotional one person goes on before leaving home to travel to the TRAPPIST-1 system. The poem, written by Sean Raymond, and titled ""An Ode to 7 Orbs,"" on the other hand, is probably geared toward a younger audience.  The first stanza:  Wake up now people, I’ve got some big news!  You won’t want to miss this. You don’t want to snooze.  We just found some planets while we were stargazing  Gather 'round, listen up. These ones are amazing! In general, basically any photo or picture you see of TRAPPIST-1 and its planets is art in some form. Scientists aren't sure what kind of atmospheres envelop these worlds, and who knows if any of them can actually sustain liquid water on their surfaces, much less life.   Artist's impression showing a view above the surface of one of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. But artists working for NASA and other science organizations are still taking the small bits of what we do know of the worlds to create illustrations that resemble what they might look like if we actually made our way there.  A new 360-degree video, for example, shows you exactly what it might be like to stand on the sunny side of one planet, which is probably tidally locked (meaning: the same side of the world always points toward its host star).  NASA's also released a ""travel poster"" advertising (fake) tourist trips to ""planet hop"" around the TRAPPIST-1 star system. In reality, it might be possible to hop around the alien star system once you get there.  Like Jupiter and many of its moons, the planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1 are all very close to their star. Because their orbits are so interconnected, they also exert influence over one another, shifting the way they travel around the star. This could make travel between the world at least slightly easier. Who knows—maybe traveling around TRAPPIST-1 could one day be as easy as moving from one Greek island to the next.  "

437,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - At least 33 people have tested positive for HIV in the northern Indian town of Bangarmau after an unqualified medical practitioner injected some of them with an infected syringe, a government official said. The 33 were confirmed from among 566 people tested at government-organized HIV screening camps on Jan. 24, 25 and 27, according to SP Choudhary, chief medical officer (CMO) of Unnao district, which includes Bangarmau. The camps were set up after several suspected HIV cases showed up during routine tests at the district hospitals in Bangarmau late last year, he added. “We ask HIV patients various things to know the source of infection,” Choudhary said. “When we asked these patients whether they had used common syringes, some of them told us about a doctor they went to who uses the same syringe on all his patients.” Arun Pratap Singh, a Bangarmau police official, said an investigative file had been opened against the suspect doctor identified as Rajendra Kumar. Singh said Kumar had gone into hiding and police were searching for him. He said the doctor could be charged with carrying out a negligent act likely to spread infection of diseases, voluntarily causing grievous harm by using dangerous weapons or means, and practicing medicine without having registration as a medical practitioner with the state government. Choudhary said he was not sure how many of the 33 cases were connected to Kumar, but that an investigation by a state government committee was continuing. “Patients have told us this man is about 35 years old and would go around on a bicycle, giving out pills and injections to treat colds, coughs and other ailments. He is a quack,” Choudhary said. A shortage of doctors in India leads many patients to depend on unqualified practitioners, many of whom work out of hole-in-the-wall clinics in rural areas. The Indian Medical Association estimates that about 45 percent of the people in India who practice medicine have no formal training. Critics have in the past blamed a lack of stringent criminal penalties that allow quacks to thrive. Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state run by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has a sketchy healthcare record in a country whose spending on medical care ranks among the lowest in the world as a percentage of GDP. Dozens of deaths from encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh last year led to a firestorm of criticism of the state's chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, who took office early last year.

439,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for talk on climate, the EU’s long-term budget, Brexit, the euro zone and Russia sanctions, among others. Here are comments made by them on Thursday ahead of the summit. “Germany has already pledged to be climate neutral by 2050. We will discuss today whether all EU countries will do the same. I hope we can achieve this. It would be a strong signal that Europe is really the continent that is climate-neutral in 2050, but we must wait for the discussion.” “For those countries that have to get out of an all-coal mix, it’s clear they can’t shift toward an all-renewable mix overnight.” “They’ll have to have in their mix a share of nuclear energy if they want... Other countries are very anti-nuclear... Austria doesn’t want nuclear to be mentioned. Luxembourg doesn’t either. Germany is reluctant too. There are different political sensitivities.” “I think we can do it. That the way I see things. We just need to find the right mechanisms, be trustworthy, allow visibility, but we can do it.” “I hope that the (EU) member countries give this European Green Deal strong support.” “Global warming is written clearly in our agenda because, if we do nothing, then the extreme weather events will increase, the floods, drought in Africa... That would be really expensive. I am convinced that it is in our own interests to end this damaging climate change in a positive agenda.” “The ambitious climate goals that we have to take - the new generations are expecting us to act and we have to fulfill the expectations of the people.” “I’m worried about this climate issue. We have to do more, we have to do it faster. It’s about the future of our children.” “I am very much looking forward that we would find a common goal today.” “The goal is that the multi-annual financial framework could be agreed on by February. Finland has made its own proposal and in my opinion it’s well balanced. It’s in between what the Commission and the Parliament and the net payer countries have wanted. I believe it’s quite close to the compromise that will be reached, hopefully as soon as in February.” “One must note that the cost of the energy transformation in Poland is much higher than in other countries... like France, which developed nuclear energy and thanks to that it today has a very low-emissions energy system.” “We, of course, have to take into account all the economic and social costs for Poland.” “We will also underline the consumption aspect, which shows that some countries boasting low emissions per capita do not explain that they import a lot of goods from outside the EU, leading to a high consumption per capita.” “We stress the argument of a just energy transition and that the pace of reaching neutrality must be linked to the stage of economic development.” “We cannot agree to a model of economic transformation that would hurt the Polish society.” “Climate change is the number one priority for this afternoon’s meeting. I hope we will have an agreement. Climate neutrality is a very important goal.” “We have to discuss about the level of ambition for the next European budget. We have also discuss about the right balance between the classical policies like cohesion and agriculture, and new policies like migration, climate and innovation.” “We have also to discus this proposal of own resources.” “I always show respect for the choice of the voters. We will wait and we will see what will be the outcome of this election.” “Some people want to pay less, some people want to get more, others to do new things. I wasn’t the best at mathematics but this, I think, is not going to add up.” “Each country is free to choose its own energy mix but for it to be financed with citizens’ money - no, I am not in favor. We agree to a fund to see how we can help but to say we’ll finance it with citizens money, I am not in favor.” “Either we understand we are in self-destruction mode and we want to sound alarm and realize we must do something, or we don’t care, we do the ostrich politics, we don’t care.” “I don’t need to hear the Greenpeace message to know that we need to do something.” “Get the majority in the House of Commons and be able to fulfill the agreement we decided on both sides.” “Austria’s position is clear. No nuclear energy. We support climate neutrality in 2050, but without nuclear energy, which is not safe and not sustainable.” “We are with net contributors - Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden that a target of 1% (of GNI) should and is enough.” “We are facing negotiations, or rather a battle. It is among our plans to take a joint stand to make the European economy carbon neutral by 2050. That is a huge undertaking. We all know that climate change is a big problem, and we all know that fighting against it is a huge undertaking, which costs an enormous amount of money.” “The Hungarian government is also determined to make the European economy climate neutral by 2050, so we are ready to sign an agreement to that effect. “We cannot allow Brussels bureaucrats to have poor people and poor countries to pay the costs of the fight against climate change. We must receive clear financial guarantees and we will negotiate the terms of that.” “A related side issue is the future of nuclear energy. We would like all reservations about nuclear energy here in Brussels to be set aside once and for all... Clearly there is no carbon neutral European economy without nuclear power.” “Ireland will be strongly supporting... the Green New Deal.” “It’s not about apocalypse, it’s about green growth.” “We very much want a part of that (the Just Transition Fund). We would put our midlands and our peatlands there as well.” “I just hope the results (of UK general election on Thursday) are decisive.” “For me it is important to have certainty that nobody will stop us in the construction of nuclear power units. Simply we have to have electricity for people, for firms, and heating. And that is the priority and I will see. I don’t rule out anything.” “Nuclear energy is clean energy, without any emissions. And I don’t know why a lot of countries have a problem with this.” “I don’t understand this approach, mainly from Austria.” “If we really want to reach carbon neutrality, we have to understand that each member states has a different energy mix.” “Reaching carbon neutrality for the Czech Republic will be about 30-40 billion euro.” “How will we force China and Russia and India to reduce emissions? This is a question.” “It would be really bad if we didn’t reach an agreement on 2050 target.” “It is very important that we as the EU move effectively, steps for reaching climate neutrality. I hope we agree upon text.” “If we want to attain this goal, its very important that we provide the investment to attain this goal. It’s very important to say ‘Yes, we need these climate goals’ but it’s just as important to say we need those investments.” “You cannot attain these goals without investments, we need to invest in our goals.” “To achieve climate neutrality in 2050, it costs money. According to our calculations, it will cost about two-thirds of our GDP until 2050.” “Fair conditions and access to financial resources and financial instruments will make this process transparent and all the countries will keep their competitiveness.” “Otherwise, it will be very difficult to be competitive, spend money on green economy while third countries don’t do this.” “We are not happy with the proposal of Finland. First of all, the financial volume is too small in order to achieve those ambitious goals... The Just Transition Fund is financed at the expense of cohesion funds, which is extremely important for such countries like Lithuania, Baltic countries, east of Europe, because we are in the process of converging.” “We are still lagging behind... we need faster growth.” “We have several conditions, one of the main ones is to have clearly declared technology neutrality so that each country can decide about their energy mix.” “Slovakia will join with the majority of European countries because I think the European Union must be the leader and manage to convince other states like China or India to join us.” “Estonia is supporting the EU goal of climate neutrality by 2050. It is so important for us, it is so important for Europe and of course for the world. Of the difficulties, the main aspects are energy, transport and agriculture.” “We support the Green Deal... Clearly, we will fight for funds, for example the Just Transition Fund.” “It is very good what was presented yesterday, a Green New Deal at EU level to mobilize resources and convert to green energies.” Compiled by Gabriela Baczynska, Marine Strauss, Jonas Ekblom, Philip Blenkinsop, Jason Hovet, Marton Dunai, Jan Strupczewski, Michel Rose"

442,"We need a comprehensive strategy to prevent the spread of the disease. The authors are on the faculty of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. As the United States scrambles to expand testing for coronavirus infections, the nation’s capacity for putting into place what should follow a positive result — isolating the infected and quarantining their contacts — is profoundly limited. Yet these two steps are essential for controlling the spread of Covid-19. Our national tendency is to see testing, and all health care, as being about the individual. But in this crisis, the primary purpose of testing is not self awareness; it is disease control. Reducing the chance that the virus jumps from one person to another requires linking a diagnosis to a key set of preventive actions. South Korea’s success in slowing the spread of the disease depended not just on doing many tests, but also on its comprehensive approach to following them up. When a person tests positive there, health workers track their exposures at work, at home and in public — down to where they ate out for breakfast. Taiwan launched a toll-free number for citizens to arrange testing, isolation and quarantine if needed, health checks, the delivery of food and the setting up of other resources. In the United States, the same principle applies: Testing should generate a response to prevent further transmission. Communities in the throes of a rampant epidemic must focus limited testing resources on critical needs. New York City is using its insufficient supply of tests (and the personal protective equipment to perform the tests) on critically ill patients and on health care workers. This approach makes sense. For hospitalized patients, a positive result assures that patients will be isolated, with special precautions taken. For health care workers and other essential employees, a positive result removes them from the front lines so they don’t put others at risk. In other parts of the country not yet coping with a high burden of Covid-19, tests should be used to prevent its spread among those most vulnerable to serious illness and death. In nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other congregate settings, one infection can rapidly spread to dozens of patients, many of whom will need intensive care. If proper infection control cannot be quickly established, it may be necessary to move the infected to temporary accommodations. Seattle is using a motel to house homeless individuals so they don’t spread the disease in shelters. Once vulnerable populations are covered, it makes sense to test others with symptoms of the coronavirus infection. But here’s the key: Every positive test should set off urgent steps to identify and quarantine their contacts. Within hours of a positive result, public health workers should be retracing the steps of the infected person. Then, through text messaging and phone calls, contacts should be asked to quarantine themselves for 14 days and track their symptoms. Public health workers should arrange access to care for those contacts if symptoms develop and assist them with relocation if that is needed to protect others. In Manhattan, for instance, the Four Seasons New York last week began offering front-line doctors, nurses and other medical personnel free rooms to reduce the chance they might spread the disease to family members or others. Public funding should also be made available to support those who need assistance in order to self quarantine. It’s an understatement to say that state and local public health agencies lack sufficient staffing and resources for the scale of the public health response needed. China’s response reportedly involved 18,000 people in Wuhan alone tracking down contacts of those who were infected. Unfortunately, public health agencies in the United States have lost 30,000 employees over the last seven years. What’s needed now is a huge public-private partnership. Businesses and community organizations should staff, public health schools should help train, and then agencies should direct an army of public health workers in an aggressive campaign of post-testing follow-up. Insurers and other major consumer businesses should make available their call centers to enable trained workers to help people get tested, instruct callers on requirements for isolation and quarantine, and link them to the resources they need to comply. We need places to house those who cannot stay at home — including hotels, dorm rooms and convention centers. We shouldn’t wait for broad testing availability to get started. Identifying symptoms can point to those who are likely to be infected, and we should proceed from there. That’s why call centers, contact tracing and isolation support must be activated now. Then, as testing becomes more available, these follow-up strategies will become more targeted and effective. The critical question for the United States is not how many coronavirus tests are being done. It’s how many diagnoses are leading to action. While tests are scarce, those who can stay home with a mild illness or no symptoms should do so, leaving the tests to those most at risk of passing the infection to others. Responding quickly and effectively prevents the spread of coronavirus. Doing so is vital to the health of us all. Joshua M.

443,"BERLIN, April 24 (Reuters) - A dip in German business morale in April points to economic growth in Europe's largest economy being weaker than 0.8 percent this year, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said on Wednesday. The industrial sector is dragging down the economy, he said, adding that a delay to a decision on Britain's departure from the European Union had not helped German business morale. Germany's domestic economy remained an important pillar of support, he said. (Writing by Paul Carrel Editing by Michelle Martin)"
444,"Steve Bullock, the latest Democrat to enter the presidential race, was twice elected governor of deep-red Montana. In 2016, in fact, more than 20 percent of Trump voters also voted to re-elect him. But while Mr. Bullock has promoted centrist policies in some areas, as would be expected from a Democrat in a conservative state, he leans left on other issues. Here’s a look at where he stands. Mr. Bullock’s signature issue is money in politics, especially the deluge unleashed by the Citizens United ruling in 2010: hundreds of millions of dollars from corporations and wealthy individuals who don’t have to be publicly identified. His premise is that this “dark money” has poisoned the political system, and the public’s faith in the system’s integrity, such that the government can’t address other problems without addressing this one first. In 2015, he worked with Republicans in the Montana Legislature to require political action committees to identify their donors. And last July, he sued the Trump administration in an effort to preserve a similar requirement for political nonprofits like the National Rifle Association and Planned Parenthood. [Announcing his bid, Mr. Bullock said defeating a corrupt system was “the fight of my career.”] Infrastructure has been another focus for Mr. Bullock, who is calling for nearly $300 million in spending on Montana’s roads, bridges, sewage and water lines, and other systems. He has also emphasized the need for high-speed internet access in rural areas to close “the rural-urban divide.” Last year, in another major action on internet access, he became the first governor to sign an executive order to restore net neutrality rules at the state level after the Federal Communications Commission repealed it nationally. Other governors followed his lead. Mr. Bullock used to oppose gun control. As recently as 2016, he rejected universal background checks and emphasized that during his tenure, “our Second Amendment rights have been expanded in Montana.” More recently, however, he has shifted. In an op-ed in The Great Falls Tribune last year, he wrote that he had come to support universal background checks, magazine size limits and extreme risk protection laws. (Commonly known as red-flag laws, these measures allow the temporary removal of firearms from people who are deemed likely to become violent.) Over the summer, he went further, endorsing a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons, which he had rejected in 2009. Most of the Democrats running for president are calling for universal health care, but Mr. Bullock isn’t. Asked last year whether he supported Medicare for all, he demurred, saying there were “any number of different paths” to make health care “affordable, accessible and of quality.” He did shepherd an expansion of Medicaid through the Republican-controlled Montana Legislature in 2015. He also supports the Affordable Care Act and has spoken out against attempts to repeal or undermine it, accusing the Trump administration and congressional Republicans of trying to “sabotage” the law. As governor of Montana, which has been hit hard by droughts and fires exacerbated by climate change, Mr. Bullock has called for swift action on the environment. He condemned Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, writing on Facebook: “Ask any Montana farmer, rancher, hunter, angler or skier — climate change is real and poses a threat to our economy and way of life. To not acknowledge that or deal with it in a responsible way is shortsighted and dangerous.” But his proposals are not necessarily the same as other Democrats’. He has argued that it’s impossible to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the next 15 to 20 years — longer than the time scientists say is left for action — and that states like his own ought to test technologies that would capture carbon emissions. “You often hear a false choice: You can either address climate change or we can continue to produce power from coal and fossil fuels, but not both,” he said in 2017. “And I think we need to reject this choice.” An earlier version of this article contained outdated information about Montana’s Medicaid expansion. The expansion was renewed last week; it is no longer at risk of expiring."
445,"So much for a quiet end to the lazy days of summer in Canada. The week began with a claim from President Trump that he had stuck a trade deal with Mexico and a demand that Canada sign on by Friday. Friday came, the deadline passed and talks will resume next week — although it’s possible that everything may have changed again by the time many of you read this on Saturday morning.

The already overheated debate over expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to an oil tanker port in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby became even hotter on Thursday when the Federal Court of Appeal slapped down the government for not conducting sincere and meaningful consultations with Indigenous people. The court also ordered the National Energy Board to look at the environmental effects of more tankers in the waters off British Columbia’s coast. [Read: Canadian Court Halts Expansion of Trans Mountain Oil Pipeline] Though the project is unpopular with many Liberal supporters, the government had solidly backed the expansion of the pipeline it is soon to purchase, in part as a way to get Alberta onside with its carbon tax program. So it wasn’t surprising to see an angry Rachel Notley, Alberta’s premier, appearing on television a few hours after the news broke to announce that her province’s government was pulling out of the carbon reduction program until construction workers actually start building the pipeline expansion. But Ms. Notley, whose political fortunes also rest on the project, wasn’t the only person with tart words for Mr. Trudeau. Many Indigenous groups, who were the main applicants in the lawsuit, called on the prime minister to kill the expansion, as did environmentalists and politicians on the left. Some are opposed because the pipeline mainly carries oil from Alberta’s oil sands, which they regard as a particularly polluting energy source. Others, including John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia, fear catastrophe if a tanker sinks or splits open off the province’s coast. On the other side, Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader, charged that Mr. Trudeau had bungled the issue. So what’s a prime minister to do? As part of his oft-stated position that Canada needs the economic strength of its energy industry as it deals with climate change, Mr. Trudeau announced in May that the government would buy Trans Mountain from its American owner. That company, Kinder Morgan, had earlier abandoned plans to expand the pipeline over opposition from British Columbia’s government. Mr. Trudeau’s promise to finish the project has made the government a player in the energy industry for the first time since it created and owned Petro-Canada. And that’s led to criticism from the right, even among those who support pipelines. Opponents of the expansion were quick to portray the Court of Appeal’s decision as a crippling blow to the expansion plans. But legal experts I spoke to, and even the ruling itself, suggest that description might be a vast overstatement. The ruling does not give Indigenous groups an effective veto over the pipeline, nor does it require the government to negotiate with the groups. The government does, however, have to go back and do a better job of consulting with them, a process experts say could take as little as six months. As for the marine review, the government claims to have already assessed those issues, just not through the National Energy Board. So that may be cleared up just as quickly. Taking care of the legal questions, of course, will only get pipeline construction crews to work. Calming the political tensions won’t be as easy. For Mr. Trudeau, the biggest challenge may be stopping Trans Mountain from turning into something that ultimately satisfies no one. Last year Catherine Porter, our Toronto bureau chief, wrote about an ambitious project that was then underway on British Columbia’s west coast: Canada’s first Haida-language feature film. [Read: Reviving a Lost Language of Canada Through Film] “Edge of the Knife” will debut at the Toronto International Film Festival next Friday, Sept. 7. The film has an entirely Haida cast, and retells the Haida story of the “wildman,” who is lost and becomes feral in the forest. In this telling, the wildman loses his mind after the death of a child, and is brought back to his community through a healing ceremony.

446,"(Repeats earlier item for additional readers with no changes to headline or text) By David Henry NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks are spending millions of dollars to promote Zelle, their digital payment service, by running commercials on major sports games and entertainment shows, as well as a YouTube campaign painting the app as simple and ubiquitous. The ads reflect a two-pronged effort by banks, industry insiders said: to wean customers from costly physical services like paper checks and branches, and gains on Venmo, a better-known payments app offered by PayPal Holdings Inc . Venmo, launched in 2009, became popular among the coveted millennial demographic, primarily through word of mouth. Zelle broke onto the scene less than a year ago after the big banks haggled over marketing and computer networking arrangements for a decade. Zelle is now in the hands of many more people than Venmo, and the network already processes more than twice as much in payments, as measured by dollar volume. But its brand recognition is low. [reut.rs/2DBPI1H ] So far, 95 million customers have access to Zelle through their banks, which are plugged into the network, said Lou Anne Alexander, group president for payments at Early Warning Services, the bank consortium operating the service. Lately about 100,000 people a day have been signing into Zelle for the first time. Early Warning would not say how many people regularly use the service. One new ad features 30-something rapper and Broadway actor Daveed Diggs as a modern-world laggard who insists on using money rather than Zelle to pay a friend. On the way to a bank branch, he encounters a bus driver, a dog walker, a sanitation worker and an older woman in an electric wheelchair who all know about Zelle. “Why am I walking to the bank?” Diggs bemoans by the end of the commercial. The banks started to run ads nationally this month during National Football League playoff games and the Grammy Awards. Though Zelle would not say what its TV ad budget was, a spot can cost from $500,000 to well over $1 million, according to advertising trade publications. The banks have also put Zelle on billboards in stadiums, big-city retail centers and the New York City subway system. Members of the bank consortium, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp, are placing their own ads to attract more users. The marketing campaign aims to get Zelle firmly planted in the minds of customers, ranging from ages 18 to 54, said Alexander. The ads aim “to make consumers aware that the majority of them already have access to Zelle in their banking app,” she said. In 2017, Zelle transferred $75 billion through 247 million transactions. PayPal, which will report full-year results on Wednesday, has said that Venmo handled $30 billion in the 12 months through September. PayPal has no plans to advertise Venmo beyond its millennial base, spokesman Josh Criscoe told Reuters. Zelle’s ad campaign may signal that the banks and PayPal are going in different directions to make money from the services, which are free to individuals. PayPal promotes Venmo as a valuable marketing tool for merchants who like that its users share on social media how they spend money. Some 3.5 million merchants are signed up to accept payments from Venmo, which receives fees for processing transactions. Zelle can save money for banks as they spend less, for example, on stocking ATMs with cash, said Mark Monaco, head of Enterprise Payments at Bank of America Corp. Banks hope that Zelle is a way to “cross-sell” products, analysts said, such as deposit accounts and mortgage and auto loan offers, said Michael Moeser, a payments analyst at Javelin Research & Strategy. Corporate customers, such as insurance companies, and governments could save money by paying more of their own customers digitally on Zelle rather than with paper checks, Moeser said.

447,"Facebook shareholders will confront Mark Zuckerberg over the social network's role in spreading fake news at the company's annual meeting on Thursday, arguing that democracy is at risk every time it tweaks an algorithm. Impact investing funds Arjuna Capital and Baldwin Brothers are set to put forward proposals at the annual meetings of Facebook and, next week, Alphabet, demanding that the companies evaluate the impact of fake news flows on their reputations and whether it will create public policy risks. Natasha Lamb, Arjuna's director of equity research and shareholder engagement, said she believed that even though both companies had taken steps to address the problem of fake news spreading online, neither had gone far enough. ""Both prefer to see themselves as neutral technology platforms but they have been transformed into media platforms — that is why we are so concerned,"" she said. Facebook already stands to suffer under German legislation that would impose fines of millions of euros on social networks that do not remove fake news or hate speech, she added. Ms Lamb is hoping to meet Facebook management at the meeting on Thursday, but they have not yet confirmed. ""The big risk to Facebook is a loss in user trust and people getting what has been coined 'Facebook fatigue' and turning away from the platform,"" she said. ""When false content is being propagated at scale over Facebook's platform, that presents a real risk not only to the company and user trust in the content they find on Facebook but also to our democracy and having an informed electorate."" Facebook has been under fire after several of the most shared stories on the social network during the US presidential election campaign were fake, prompting questions about their role in the election of President Donald Trump. After Mr Zuckerberg initially dismissed the allegations that the platform had influenced the election as ""pretty crazy"", it has since shown signs of taking the issue more seriously. Facebook has tried to cut off financial incentives to fake news websites, is partnering with fact-checkers around the world to identify hoaxes, and has created a journalism project to work more closely with legitimate publishers. Facebook opposes the measure set to be put forward, arguing that it has been working to address the issue of false news and hoaxes for years and the content is already prohibited by its community standards and terms of service. Alphabet, Google's parent, also recommends stockholders vote against the proposal. Analysts at Sustainalytics, a provider of environmental, social and governance research on companies, said in a report on Tuesday that they thought investors would become more interested in how companies protected themselves from the risks of fake news. Only 16 per cent of media and internet companies studied had what the analysts called ""adequate or strong"" measures in place to tackle false information, with the analysts giving Alphabet and Facebook lower scores than media companies such as Thomson Reuters and the New York Times, and a far lower score than the top-rated company, the broadcaster Sky."

450,"The central bank is expected to keep rates steady at its final meeting of 2019. Investors want to know how long the pause will last. WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its final meeting of the year on Wednesday as officials wait to see how the economy fares after they cut rate three times in 2019. The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, and his colleagues made an aggressive shift this year. After slowly raising rates between late 2015 and 2018 to keep an expanding economy operating at an even keel, they lowered them between July and October as President Trump’s trade war roiled business confidence and global growth slowed. Their moves seem to have helped, and growth looks to be on sounder footing. Policymakers have signaled that they will now leave rates unchanged until something causes them to reassess the outlook, a message that economists expect the Fed to reaffirm in its post-meeting statement and new economic projections on Wednesday afternoon. “Markets get, loud and clear, that the Fed feels the current policy rate is appropriate,” said Michelle Girard, chief United States economist for NatWest Markets. Ms. Girard said investors would now be on the lookout “for any sign — for any more information — about what would lead to a change in their thinking.” Trade remains a critical wild card for the central bank. Mr. Trump’s spat with China and other trading partners continues to stoke business uncertainty and weigh on investment, and while the tensions have shown recent signs of easing, how they will end is anyone’s guess. Barring a last-minute delay, another round of tariffs on Chinese goods is to go into effect on Sunday, at which point the United States will have imposed levies on nearly every shoe, laptop and bicycle imported from China. “Policy changes in the speed of a tweet,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “As good as they feel about things, they also know how fast they can change.” Recent economic data has been solid, allowing the Fed to remain patient. The job market is expanding, unemployment is at its lowest level in 50 years, and wages are gradually rising, which should fuel consumer spending. The expansion is powering through a record 11th year with steady growth. While factory activity remains subdued and economies abroad are shaky, both have shown improvement over the past month. At the same time, inflation remains mired below the central bank’s 2 percent target. Without faster price gains, Mr. Powell and his colleagues are in no rush to raise rates to guard against an economic overheating. “We see a high bar for policy moves in either direction,” economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note previewing the meeting. Still, the economy’s calm surface conceals longer-term challenges, ones that Mr. Powell could be asked about during his 2:30 p.m. news conference, a half-hour after the Fed’s policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, issues its statement. Interest rates are set in a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent after the Fed’s three cuts this year, leaving officials with limited room to lower borrowing costs to revive the economy in the next recession. The Fed cut rates by about 5 percentage points — to near zero — to help cushion the blow from the last downturn. Subdued inflation further limits that leeway, because the Fed’s policy rate incorporates price changes. Lower inflation means less space to cut. Officials have spent 2019 carrying out a “framework review,” re-examining the way they approach their inflation target, their tools to combat economic slumps and their communications practices. Next year will be decision time: The process, which Mr. Powell instigated and which Vice Chair Richard Clarida is leading, is expected to wrap up in the summer. The central bank, before too long, may need to unveil a longer-term fix for an obscure but critical market that has been in turmoil in recent months. Rates in the repurchase market, which banks and hedge funds use for short-term loans, spiked in mid-September. A confluence of factors — including a corporate-tax due date and a raft of Treasury bond issuance — helped to create a cash squeeze, pushing the so-called repo rates as high as 10 percent from around 2 percent normally. The rupture spilled over to other important money markets, lifting the Fed’s key interest rate briefly above its targeted range. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York intervened for the first time since the financial crisis to smooth things over. It has continued to do so, though officials have made it clear that they do not want to remain active in the market indefinitely. The Fed’s own policy approach probably contributed to the September issues. The central bank had been gradually shrinking its portfolio of government-backed bonds — swollen by post-recession stimulus programs — until late this summer, draining money from the financial system in the process. As of October, it began to buy Treasury bills again to ensure that there are enough cash holdings at the Fed, or reserves, to keep markets well supplied. For now, Fed officials will probably signal that they are ready to act to keep money markets under control headed into the end of the year, when banks tend to hoard their reserves for regulatory reasons, potentially pushing repo rates up again. “I would expect them to effectively say that we’re going to do whatever it takes to make sure that year-end goes smoothly,” said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at J.P. Morgan. Political dynamics are also likely to be a consideration heading into 2020, even if Mr. Powell and his colleagues would prefer not to talk about them. Mr. Trump has regularly pressured the central bank to ease monetary policy more aggressively, calling for negative interest rates and labeling Mr. Powell both an “enemy” and a bad golfer over the last 12 months. The central bank, which is independent of the White House but answers to Congress, has done its best to stay out of the fray. But it could remain in Mr. Trump’s sights as he returns to campaigning, given that he regularly criticized the Fed while on the 2016 campaign trail. “They’d really love to stay on the sidelines — and stay out of the news — in an election year,” Ms. Swonk said. But if trade conflicts or other risks threaten the economy, the Fed will need to stand ready to move again, political cycle notwithstanding. “The biggest challenge is to stay on the sidelines,” she said, “but to also know when that won’t be right.”"

452,"Ross Douthat In the fall of 2014, Oprah Winfrey ran a “transformative two-day live event,” a traveling roadshow that was held in eight cities around the country. For this interactive revival-tent experience, she was joined by her “handpicked life trailblazers,” authors and personalities whose work she considered essential for the theme of the roadshow, “The Life You Want.” The trailblazers included, among others, Iyanla Vanzant, a spiritual teacher of New Thought, a 19th-century movement with links to Christian Science that emphasizes the idea of God as “infinite intelligence” and the human capacity to think our way toward godlike power ... Rob Bell, an erstwhile evangelical megachurch pastor who has reinvented himself as an itinerant preacher of the vaguest sort of Christianity ... Elizabeth Gilbert, author of “Eat Pray Love,” the megaselling memoir about finding religious ecstasy in India (as well as great pasta in Italy and a hot romance in Bali) ... Mark Nepo, the poet-philosopher author of “The Book of Awakening” and other tracts on the spirituality of the everyday ... and of course Deepak Chopra, the aging prince of the New Age. I list these figures and their theologies because in all the thousands of words that the political press has written about Oprah since her Golden Globes speech on Sunday night invited 2020 presidential speculation, there has not been nearly enough focus on the most important aspect of Oprah’s public persona, the crucial and fascinating role she really occupies in American life. We’ve heard about Oprah the entrepreneur, Oprah the celebrity, Oprah the champion of holistic medicine and the enabler of anti-vaccine paranoia, even Oprah the neoliberal (don’t ask). But though she is entrepreneurial and rich, Oprah is not Jeff Bezos; though she is famous, she is not the Rock; though she has elevated various dubious approaches to wellness, she is not Gwyneth Paltrow. Instead, her essential celebrity is much closer to the celebrity of Pope Francis or Billy Graham. She is a preacher, a spiritual guru, a religious teacher, an apostle and a prophetess. Indeed, to the extent that there is a specifically American religion, a faith tradition all our own, Oprah has made herself its pope. In other columns I have suggested that American culture is divided between three broad approaches to religious questions: one traditional, one spiritual and one secular. The traditional approach takes various forms (Catholic and Protestant, Muslim and Orthodox Jewish) but its instincts are creedal, confessional, dogmatic; it believes in a specific revelation, a specific authority and a specific holy book, and seeks to conform itself to teachings handed down from the religious past. The secular approach is post-religious, scientistic, convinced that the laboratory and the microscope will ultimately account for everything that matters, while hopefully justifying a liberal society’s still-somewhat-Christian moral commitments along the way. But in between secularism and traditionalism lies the most American approach to matters of faith: a religious individualism that blurs the line between the God out there and the God Within, a gnostic spirituality that constantly promises access to a secret and personalized wisdom, a gospel of health and wealth that insists that the true spiritual adept will find both happiness and money, a do-it-yourself form of faith that encourages syncretism and relativism and the pursuit of “your truth” (to borrow one of Oprah’s Golden Globes phrases) in defiance of the dogmatic and the skeptical alike. Because this kind of faith is not particularly political, because it’s too individualistic and personalized (and comfortable with the post-Me Decade American status quo) to be partisan and programmatic, it doesn’t always get the attention it deserves from a press accustomed to analyzing everything in terms of the clash of left and right. Not that it doesn’t have partisan tilts and colorations. Some of its manifestations are more common in conservative America — where they usually have an evangelical and commercial gloss, as with Joel Osteen and his epigones. (This red-state style of spirituality was recently co-opted, with some success, by the prosperity preacher known as Donald Trump.) Others are more common in liberal communities — where they emphasize Eastern wisdom and Lost Christianities and the New Age and Esalen-style mystical humanism. Where the spiritual worldview blurs into secularism, it’s usually claiming scientific bona fides; where it blurs into traditional religion it’s usually talking about Jesus. And Oprah herself, with her Obama-endorsing, #MeToo politics and her tendency to mix spirituality with pseudoscience, is clearly somewhat on the blue-state side of that divide ... ... but only somewhat, because the divide between blue-state spirituality and red-state spirituality is much more porous than other divisions in our balkanized society, and the appeal of the spiritual worldview cuts across partisan lines and racial divides. (Health-and-wealth theology is a rare pan-ethnic religious movement, as popular among blacks and Hispanics as among Americans with Joel Osteen’s skin tone, and when Oprah touts something like “The Secret,” the power-of-spiritual-thinking tract from the author Rhonda Byrne, she’s offering a theology that’s just Osteen without Jesus.) Indeed, it may be the strongest force holding our metaphysically divided country together, the soft, squishy, unifying center that keeps secularists and traditionalists from replaying the Spanish Civil War. Which is not to say that it’s a good force in its own right; you could fill a book (as I once tried to do) with theological and sociological arguments about what’s wrong with religious individualism, its false ideas and fatal consequences. But it clearly holds the balance of power in our cultural conflicts, and it’s hard to imagine our civic peace surviving without the bipartisan influence of its soothing faux profundities. I know, I know: You’ve stuck around this long to find out what all this religious business means for an Oprah presidential campaign. The disappointing answer is that I have no definite idea. It could be that Oprah would cease to be a figure of the spiritual center the instant she assumed a partisan mantle, that in entering in the political fray she would automatically lose her papal tiara. Or it could be that her religious authority would make the Democratic Party far more popular and powerful, more a pan-racial party of the cultural center and less a party defined by its secular and anticlerical left wing. It could be that she would be extremely effective in the increasingly imperial role that our presidency plays, effectively uniting throne and altar and presiding over our divisions with a kind of spirituality-drenched “mass empathy,” to quote Business Insider’s Josh Barro, that our present partisans conspicuously lack. Or it could be that by turning the spiritual center to partisan ends she would hasten its collapse, heightening polarization and hustling us deeper into metaphysical civil war. All of these scenarios seem possible, even as the most plausible scenario remains the one where she decides being a prophetess is better than being a president and declines to run at all. But either way, the Oprah boomlet is a chance to recognize her real importance in our culture — and the sheer unpredictable weirdness, perhaps eclipsing even Donald Trump’s ascent, that might follow if our most important religious leader tries to lay claim to temporal power as well."
453,"Not only are teenagers spending a lot of time staring at screens, they're also often choosing their careers based on what they see there. A quarter of high school students pick their future career based not on advice or personal interest, but rather on how they've seen that occupation represented on TV or in the movies, according to research released this week by Careerbuilder. That guides their decisions about what to study as undergrads. But then, a few years down the road, roughly a third of full-time employees regret the major they chose. With the rising cost of education and growing threat of an automated workforce, choosing a career that provides reliable opportunities and a decent paycheck is more important than ever. According to Careerbuilder, these are the top jobs that pay strong wages, show steady growth and provide young employees with a good number of coworkers around their age (who may be better-equipped to grasp their use of work-related emojis). And while some of these may seem less familiar, others you may even have seen on TV! Don't miss: If billionaire Richard Branson were 20 again, here's what he would do"
454,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Dollar index trades flat in early Asian trade * Sterling down by 0.1 percent By Vatsal Srivastava SINGAPORE, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The dollar traded narrowly against its peers on Monday, as risk sentiment remained fragile over heightened concerns of slowing global growth and a partial U.S. government shutdown. Markets will be closely watching the progress of trade talks between Washington and Beijing in the new year. In a tweet which would come as a sigh of relief to the markets, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he had a “long and very good call” with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and that a possible trade deal between the United States and China was progressing well. The Australian dollar gained 0.1 percent to $0.7049. The fortunes of the Australian economy are closely tied to China, its largest trading partner. “High beta and emerging market currencies will likely outperform if we get a trade agreement. Given the improving risk sentiment following the trade deal and some underlying weakness in the U.S. economy, I would consider positive trade developments as negative for the dollar,” said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore. The two nations have been in a trade war for much of 2018, shaking world financial markets as the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods between the world’s two largest economies has been disrupted by tariffs. “So far signals are positive...we could see some form of an agreement by February,” Sim said, adding that given the pressures from the stock market he expected Trump to move forward towards a truce. Trade concerns have hurt China’s economy this year and analysts expect its manufacturing sector to have contracted for the first time in more than two years. Chinese PMI data is scheduled to be released later on Monday. The dollar index, a gauge of its value versus six major peers was marginally lower, fetching 96.35 in early Asian trade. The U.S. currency has been hurt in recent weeks by rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause its tightening cycle sooner than expected, or potentially harm the U.S. economy with further interest rate increases. Falling U.S. bond yields have also dampened investor sentiment towards the dollar in recent weeks. Despite the recent pressure on the greenback, the dollar index has gained 4.6 percent this year. This has primarily been due to a robust American economy, falling unemployment and rising wage pressures. These economic fundamentals allowed the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates four times in 2018, with analysts now expecting possibly another 1-2 hikes if economic momentum does not falter. The yen was changing hands at 110.34 per dollar, a touch lower versus the greenback. The safe-haven yen has strengthened by 2.8 percent versus the dollar in the last two weeks of the year as investors sought its safety due to growing concerns of slowing economic growth, U.S.-Sino trade tensions and highly volatile moves in global equities. The yen gained despite soft Japanese data and a decline in benchmark Japanese bond yields, which fell back into negative territory for the first time in more than a year, indicating the high level of risk aversion underscoring the financial markets in December. The Swiss franc, another safe haven, traded steady at 0.9848. The franc has gained versus the dollar for two straight weeks due to risk-off positioning in the currency markets. The euro quoted at $1.1440, trading flat versus the dollar. Although the single currency has gained versus the greenback in recent weeks, economic growth and inflation in Europe remain much weaker than the European Central Bank’s expectations. The euro is set to lose around 4.5 percent versus the dollar in 2018. Elsewhere, sterling, which has been battered this year due to Brexit woes, was fetching $1.2700. The pound has lost 6 percent of its value versus the dollar this year. With three months left until the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal is floundering. (Editing by Jacqueline Wong)"
455,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Jamie McGeever LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The onset of world financial market stress is usually heralded by the ringing of several alarm bells, few of them louder than a steep and rapid rise in the value of the Japanese yen. Worryingly for investors as 2019 gets underway, not only is the yen surging, other warning signs are flashing too, suggesting we are in for a volatile and choppy year. Bond yields are plunging, gold is rising, U.S. financial conditions are tightening, and cash is king. Little surprise, therefore, that the Japanese currency on Thursday had its best day since May 2017 after a flash crash in illiquid Asian trading briefly slammed the dollar below 105.00 yen. Implied volatility in dollar/yen is the highest since last February’s “volmageddon” episode and the weekly standard deviation is the highest in over two years. Meanwhile, worries over global growth, trade wars, and a rare revenue warning from Apple are slamming stock markets around the world. The yen has become the totem safe-haven asset for investors over the years, despite Japan’s relatively sluggish economic growth and low - even negative - interest rates and bond yields. In benign market conditions, Japanese investors pour money into a range of assets overseas, seeking relatively higher rates of return. In times of stress, this so-called carry trade is reversed and the considerable repatriation flow of funds boosts the yen, sometimes suddenly and sharply. That wall of cash has grown substantially in recent years. According to Morgan Stanley, Japanese investors’ portfolio investment into U.S. assets has more than doubled in the last 15 years to some $1.25 trillion. These holdings have increased by more than $400 billion since 2011 alone, mostly in riskier equities. When market storm clouds gather, Japanese investor demand for home currency rockets. Previous bouts of intense market volatility over the last 20 years have triggered similar warning shots to those being fired now. Amid the swirling chaos of the Asian, Russian and LTCM crises in September-October 1998, U.S. financial conditions tightened sharply, with the St. Louis Fed’s Financial Stress Index reaching 1.535 in the week ending Oct. 16. Outside the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-08, that is the highest level since the index was launched in 1994. It is at a much lower level today, but it’s still the highest since March 2016, and rising. In early October 2008, just days before Lehman, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was above 4.00 pct, and by the end of the year it was barely holding above 2.00 pct. Remarkably, considering the Fed is still raising interest rates, the 10-year yield has fallen 60 basis points in the last two months. While these moves are a clear reflection of darkening market clouds, they are relative slow burners. For a more instant view, those of us with a few miles on the clock instinctively look to dollar/yen. On Oct. 7, 1998, the dollar plunged more than 10 big figures, or 7 percent. It remains dollar/yen’s biggest single-day fall in 45 years, leading to a daily standard deviation move of almost 7.0 the following day, also the biggest rise in 45 years by that particular measure. That was my first week as a financial journalist. I had no idea what a big move in the Japanese currency signified or why it mattered, but it proved to be my first and probably most enduring lesson on markets. In the second half of the following year, the dollar lost 20 pct against the yen, almost falling below 100.00 yen. It wasn’t long before the U.S. tech bubble burst and the U.S. economy slipped into recession, albeit a shallow one. Rapid yen appreciation in 2008 coincided with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the carnage that then swept through global markets. Dollar/yen again tumbled some 20 percent in the second half of that year, and the daily standard deviation of 2.72 on Oct. 27 remains the highest since the October 1998 turmoil. A series of steep declines in the first half of 2016 saw the dollar slide below 100.00 yen, as fears over China’s economy gripped investors and Beijing’s international reserves were ultimately drawn down to a six-year low of $3 trillion. Here in the first few trading days of 2019, the yen is on the move again. And like those previous bouts of market volatility and weakness, it is not in isolation: gold and high-rated sovereign government bonds are also rising strongly, yield curves are flattening and banking stocks are underperforming. Hold onto your hats, and keep a close eye on the yen. By Jamie McGeever, editing by Larry King"
456,"GERMANS’ love of meat is well-known. The country has one of the highest per capita meat-consumption figures in the world, with the average citizen chomping down 59kg a year in 2016. In Berlin there’s a museum dedicated solely to the Currywurst, the classic sausage dish served everywhere in the Hauptstadt on crimped paper plates. Human-sized, grinning sausage mascots can be spotted all over the city outside fast-food stands. Many in Germany consider eating meat, and pork in particular, a key part of national identity. Election posters for Alternative für Deutschland, a far-right party, featured a piglet and an Islamophobic slogan, promoting prejudice against Muslims’ culinary rules. The complicated significance of fleisch for Germans is contained in the word itself. Meaning both “meat” and “flesh”, the term designates human bodily matter as well as what goes on a plate. It is these tangled connotations that a new exhibition at the Altes Museum digs into, utilising the breadth of the State Museum’s historical and ethnographical collections to dissect the obsession with bodily tissue. It takes a cross-cultural approach, organised around themes of “Food”, “Cult” and “Body”. The 70-odd artefacts on display span Chinese tablets from the 2nd century BC to contemporary American performance art and a “Percy Pig” cuddly toy made this year. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. It is only recently that Western consumers have become separated from the meat they eat. Photos from the 1970s show “meat carriers” walking down a Berlin street with hacked-open carcasses hanging around their necks like travel pillows. A huge butcher’s hook from 1600 hangs solemnly in a glass case as a reminder that this grisly, wrought-iron object is how dead flesh has been stored for much of human history: it makes today’s supermarkets, with their packaged sausages and frozen lamb chops, look bloodlessly sanitised by contrast. This change in the visibility of animal slaughter informs Christian Jankowski’s humorous work “The Hunt” from 1992, in which the performance artist took a bow and arrow into a supermarket to “hunt down” his weekly shop. A frozen chicken, toilet paper and margarine all get pinged with Mr Jankowski’s arrows, but his hunter-gatherer approach only takes him as far as the till, where the cashier patiently puts through each of his pierced purchases. As well as considering attitudes to the meat industry, the exhibition also looks at what is done with meat once it is on plates. Abisag Tüllmann, a German photographer, created a series of photographs entitled “Wurst Essen” (“Eating Sausage”). They show, as if in a how-to guide, the four stages of the process from holding the ketchup-dipped pork package to the crumpled napkin on the paper plate at the end. Here cultures unsurprisingly differ. Also on show is a delicate wooden meat fork from the 19th century used by high-ranking dignitaries on what is now Fiji to eat cooked animal meat (as well as, disturbingly, the flesh of their killed enemies). They were not allowed to touch meat with their bare hands. The exhibition ranges beyond food to explore other pleasures of the flesh, as in a collection of Roman phallus pendants. Two statues both in gold—a Venus or Fortuna from the mid-16th century and a “muscleman” from the 18th—are juxtaposed. The male is sinewy and defined; the woman buxom and rounded. The dichotomy is a reminder of the sexual attraction of flesh as well as the need for nutrition, for filling flesh out. And while the “right” kind of naked flesh can be a sexual turn-on, it can also be a reminder of human decay. A wooden engraving of Death from the 16th century shows the figure grasping at a young woman, nude except for her jewels: his skeletal frame seeks out her feminine youth. It is a symbol that has cross-cultural appeal. A small, pre-Columbian clay sculpture from Peru depicts a woman masturbating the figure of Death, his hand reaching for her mouth. Even when it belongs to the very symbol of decay, flesh is portrayed as craving life, youth and fertility. The exhibition takes the visitor full circle here, from dead animal meat being consumed by humans for nourishment to their own flesh being consumed by the insatiable, finalising forces of death. There is an odd little idiom in German that reads: “Everything has an end, apart from the sausage, which has two”. This exhibition, which makes strong, sinewy links between concepts, takes the viewer from one end of that little flesh-filled package to the other."
457," (CNN)When William Forsyth retired after decades as a county prosecutor, the Battaglia family thanked him for convicting their son's killer -- 25 years after his murder. ""With the resolution of the case, Bill has given us the gift of healing,"" Joel Battaglia's mother, Gail, recalled saying before she embraced Forsyth at his retirement dinner in 2016.  Now, Forsyth, 68, finds himself at the helm of a high-profile case likely to demand the same persistent push for justice -- and looming promise of healing -- as he steps in as the special prosecutor investigating how former Michigan State University physician Larry Nassar could have sexually abused girls and young women for nearly 20 years without the school intervening. In 40 years as a prosecutor -- 30 of them as the top elected lawyer in Kent County, Michigan -- Forsyth tried more than 40 murder cases and oversaw thousands of others. Christopher Becker, who worked for Forsyth before succeeding him, said his former boss always made clear that lying to him or to the court or withholding evidence would get them fired. Other attorneys praised Forsyth's appointment in the Michigan State matter, calling him meticulous, detailed, fair, compassionate and genuinely concerned about crime victims.  ""He's going to look for the truth,"" Becker said. ""I think that drives him."" 'Seeking justice' In a speech last week, Forsyth talked pointedly about his search for the truth during his career -- and now. ""I've always believed as a prosecutor that probably the most important function as a prosecutor is to represent the victims of crime. And in each case, I've always tried to view it as ... seeking justice, searching for the truth and doing the right thing,"" he told reporters. ""And that philosophy has pretty much guided me in my entire career. And it's the philosophy that I'll bring to this investigation."" A Michigan judge last week sentenced Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in Ingham County, and admitted to using his trusted medical position to assault and molest girls under the guise of medical treatment. More than 150 girls and women asserted during Nassar's sentencing hearing this month that he sexually abused them under the guise of medical care as a Michigan State or USA Gymnastics physician over two decades. Now, Forsyth will lead an investigation into the school itself that began last year, according to Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette, who announced the investigation after Nassar was sentenced. Shortly after the sentencing, Michigan State President Lou Anna Simon and Athletics Director Mark Hollis also announced they would step down. Nassar had already been sentenced to 60 years in prison for federal child pornography charges and had pleaded guilty to three charges of criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County, Michigan. He is scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday on those charges. Forsyth acknowledged the complexity and scope of the investigation, which he said would be painstaking.  ""Everybody, I'm sure, would like to get this done and wrapped up as quickly as possible, while quick is a relative term depending on the context in which you're using it,"" he told reporters last week. ""And to quote legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, 'We're going to be quick, but we're not going to hurry.' We're going to do a thorough job, and we're going to do this the right way."" ""But you have to bear with us and remember what it is we're being asked to look at,"" he added. ""This is almost 20 years of predatory conduct on the part of Nassar."" ""And when we're done, I can't promise that everybody's going to be satisfied with our report and what we find,"" he said. ""But I can promise you that we're going to work extremely hard at our task, and you will get our best effort."" 'A very youthful 68-year-old' When Forsyth retired, he couldn't stay retired.  ""He's has to do something. He's a very youthful 68-year-old,"" said his daughter, Andrea Forsyth, an attorney in Grand Rapids. For several months, he returned to Kent County to help the staff prepare for the resentencing of several juveniles convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole. The work included one case he'd tried: the conviction of Federico Cruz, who killed a teenager and recorded himself talking to the severed head, Becker said.  Cruz, who was sentenced in 1997, and many other then-juvenile offenders faced resentencing in light of a US Supreme Court ruling that mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles amount to cruel and usual punishment, CNN affiliate WXMI reported. The juvenile cases are pending while the Michigan Supreme Court decides whether a jury or a judge should decide the sentences, Becker said.  More recently, when the chief of the two-person prosecution team in William Forsyth's small hometown of Standish, Michigan, said he needed an assistant, Forsyth agreed to come on board, his daughter said. A grandfather, Forsyth has always stayed active, she said. He often ran during his lunch break when he was prosecutor.  Andrea Forsyth and her father enjoy going mountain climbing together and recently scaled Mount Rainer in Washington state and Mount Whitney in California, she said. 'A model independent prosecutor' William Forsyth was doing chores around the house when Schuette -- who described the retired prosecutor as ""a man of immense integrity"" with ""an impeccable reputation"" -- called to ask him to be the special prosecutor in the Michigan State investigation, his daughter said. The job was perfect for her father, she said.  ""He's meticulous,"" she said. ""He doesn't have an agenda. He's not motivated by anything but getting to the bottom of it, getting to the truth.""  Kevin Bramble, an assistant prosecutor in Kent County, recalled Forsyth working so hard on the Cruz case that he looked drawn out in the face. ""He really poured his heart and soul into it,"" Bramble said. ""He's one of the guys that is just so thorough and doesn't leave any stone unturned."" Forsyth was an early proponent of victim advocate programs in Michigan and helped start one at the Kent County Prosecutor's Office, Becker said.  Advocates assist victims through the legal process and many times read their victim impact statements to the court. ""If you could build a model independent prosecutor, he would be it,"" said Vicki Seidl, a prosecutor in Kent County. ""You would want somebody with his charter, with his sense of right and wrong and his sense of responsibility, his sense of fairness."" Battaglia said she witnessed Forsyth's compassion when her son's killer was sentenced. Tears welled up in his eyes during the proceeding, she said. ""He was with us in our pain and our sorrow,"" she said, ""but also our joy.""  Corrections: Earlier versions of this story incorrectly spelled the names of Vicki Seidl and Eaton County. The story also has been updated to correct a quote from Forsyth's daughter. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report. "

		Agnieszka Wilk is the founder and CEO of Decorilla. Imagine walking through the bathroom door at 7am and the shower starts itself at optimal water heat and pressure. The thermostat adjusts when you enter the room. Want a new bathroom tub? What if you could 3D print it? High-tech homes are about to revolutionize the way we live. While interior design once relied on color schemes and playful accents, new tech trends are completely revamping how we design, build and live in our spaces. Even more, they’re having a social impact, enabling users to reduce their carbon footprints and increase efficiency as they go about their daily lives. 3D printing, virtual reality and the Internet of Things (IoT) have just recently began to appear in our houses, but they’re making an incredible impact. So what capabilities do these tech trends have? And what will they look like further in the future? 3D printers can create car parts and prosthetics. They can even build entire houses. Amsterdam boasts the 3D Print Canal House, a 13-room building and museum built entirely by a giant 3D printer, called the KamerMaker. The KamerMaker 2.0 is currently underway, and prints an area about as tall as a water bottle every second. An Italian engineering company is also working on building a 3D-printed house, and believes similar ones could be built in developing countries where sturdier structures are needed. So while we may not see entire neighborhoods being built by 3D printers just yet, it’s something to look forward to in the future. We won’t be able to remember a time before we weren’t able to 3D print a new bathroom tub. It’s not to say that 3D printing isn’t mainstream yet. It is. Companies like Shapeways have users design and order their own 3D-printed items. Customers may design their items using 3D sketch apps like GravitySketch, send it to Shapeways and have their items sent directly to them. What’s more, the company lists dozens of ready-made items for the home — from book shelves to wall art — at prices comparable to High Street stores. Most items are less than US$40. “You’ll have a say in what materials you will use, what your materials will look like, and how they are made,” said Peter Limburg, Head of Business Development and Sales at Shapeways . “Mass-manufacturing is made to eliminate as much variety as we can. With 3D printing, we are allowing things to be more personal. The joy from our products will be a lot higher.” 3D printing also means we don’t rely on factories that are oceans away. Shapeways’ factory is located in Long Island, NY, and ships out 200,000 unique items each month. Additionally, 3D-printed items produce less waste — the process uses exactly the amount of material necessary to make a product and no more, reducing an individual’s carbon footprint. People involved in the industry have been forward-thinking entrepreneurs. However, as 3D printing moves to the mainstream, larger companies like HP are jumping on the bandwagon. Ricoh and Canon have both announced they will release printers, too. Limburg says these larger companies will help bring down prices and drive innovation, benefitting the entire industry. It’s confirmation, he says, that 3D printing is here to stay. VR and AR will soon play a critical role in helping people make better decisions in regards to interior design and online shopping. The tech tools will help consumers choose big-ticket items, allowing them to see how all the elements will fit into their homes without having to purchase them. Furniture companies in particular are using AR apps. Littlewoods and Very have developed AR apps that act like a personalized catalog. Instead of having to visualize how a piece of furniture will look in their home, users can scan their room with their camera and virtually place the furniture in 3D. DIRTT, a company that uses technology to manufacture highly customizable interiors, uses a VR app in their furniture showroom, increasing their in-store experience. Alper Guler is the founder of AR Pandora, a company that develops AR and VR apps. He says that people are now starting to try Google Cardboard experiences at home because they are very affordable and available through most mobile phones. However, people will be more likely to try devices such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive in physical stores and showrooms because those devices require expensive computers to run. The headgear itself cost more than US$500, as opposed to $15 for Google Cardboard. “Retailers will benefit from this by helping their customers visualize better. These technologies will help them sell more, and I think faster,” said Guler. Without these technologies, designers working online have problems with presenting to their clients. AR and VR also helps clients better imagine their newly designed spaces. Without these technologies, designers working online have problems with presenting to their clients, said Guler. “They make the [whole] design with 3D modelling tools, but when it comes to presenting it... they only take a snapshot of their 3D model... and send those images to the client,” he said. However, with AR and VR, people can see their newly designed 3D homes from any angle. VR in particular will put clients in their newly designed spaces before they even exist, offering an experience far beyond viewing flat images of their designs. Facebook has even showcased its social VR, which allows people to interact in VR together. It may seem far-fetched — reports show it will take 6-8 years for VR to go mainstream — but Facebook’s social VR pushes the boundaries. The whole notion could soon become a reality for clients and interior designers, enabling them to meet and discuss designs in VR from miles away and feel as if they are in the same new room. IoT encompasses a wide range of in-home capabilities. From thermostats to lightbulbs, ordinary objects have been given serious upgrades with IoT technology. And widespread adoption of this technology will lead to substantial energy savings. According to a study by the Consumer Technology Association, IoT could help avoid up to 100 million tons of CO2 emissions, and reduce energy consumption in each household by 10 percent. Voice-activated platforms have been popular among larger tech companies. Google just announced it would launch a voice-activated home device integrated with Google search capabilities. This would be similar to Amazon Echo, a device that sits in your home and acts as, really, a personal assistant. The Amazon device is powered by Alexa — when you speak to her, she’ll do things like turn on lights, play music and set up your Wi-Fi network. AdMobilize just built the MATRIX device, a product made to simplify the IoT space. Any connected device can be integrated into the MATRIX — it’s a central hub for all the smart devices in a home. The device downloads apps just as a smartphone would — such as ones that detect when you’ve gotten out of bed in order to turn the shower on, for example — allowing for hundreds of capabilities within the home. The technology is also touchless: users only have to gesture with their hands to turn the lights out. However, it’s not on the market yet — the company is just finishing up fabrication and has been taking pre-orders. “It’s going to change the home because it’s going to allow people to interact with technology without having it impair their life,” said Isabella Mongalo, Brand Manager at AdMobilize . “[It’s] creating a really natural way for people to interact with technology and to have a smart home in a way that is really seamless and touchless.” The average home may not yet see 3D-printed items or smart devices, but they will soon. More and more AR, VR, 3D printing and IoT will enter our homes — and stay. The devices will alter and improve the way we interact with and customize our homes, until we won’t be able to remember a time before we weren’t able to 3D print a new bathroom tub."

460,"Being able to take your music wherever you go is one of the great wonders of Bluetooth and smartphone technology. It's even better when you have a portable Bluetooth speaker on hand to boost the sound quality. Ideally though, you want a waterproof Bluetooth speaker.  Besides protecting your beats in a sudden rain shower, a waterproof Bluetooth speaker means you can take it to a pool party and not worry about a thing. Some portable Bluetooth speakers even float in the water, becoming a cool feature piece to show off to your friends.  There are hundreds of different Bluetooth speakers out there, depending on your budget and needs. It's tough to know which one's right for you, so we thought we'd do all the hard work for you and research the best waterproof Bluetooth speaker for the job.  You want to focus on a few important things while purchasing a waterproof Bluetooth speaker. For one thing, not all waterproofing is the same. It's easy to get confused by IP ratings that tell you exactly how waterproof (or merely water-resistant) something is. Ideally, you want something that's at least IP67 rated. That means it can be submerged in about a meter of water for 30 minutes without any issue. All the speakers listed here are at least IP67 rated. Water-resistant is no good because it just survives an occasional splash. You can't toss it into the pool and expect it to last. You want it to be lightweight too as, otherwise, the idea of a portable Bluetooth speaker will seem a little pointless if it's tough to carry around. Having a waterproof Bluetooth speaker is no use if the sound quality is bad though, so we've also taken into consideration how good your music sounds through the speakers. Life's too short for dull sounding beats, right?  It's also important to consider battery life. Your Bluetooth speaker is portable for a reason and you don't want to have to take a charger with you everywhere you go. Being able to charge the portable speaker and not worry about it for the rest of the day is the sweet spot here.  Range is another thing to consider. If you're sitting nearby your speaker, it doesn't really matter. But if you're having a party, you might want the flexibility of moving your phone (and you) quite far away from the setup. There's never a time where you want less range so you might as well aim for the best Bluetooth range possible, right? A good waterproof Bluetooth speaker won't be the cheapest Bluetooth speaker out there, but it will stand you in good stead for a number of years to come.

462,"trade talks@ * Investors hope for end to U.S.-China trade dispute * Safe havens fall after China confirms talks * Safran, Dassault Aviation among top European gainers * Sterling loses some gains on election worries * World FX rates in 2019: http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - European shares rose to fresh one-month highs and safe-haven assets such as gold and the yen fell after news of U.S.-China talks set for early October raised hopes of a de-escalation in their trade war before it further damages the world economy. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.63% to touch its highest level since Aug. 1. France's CAC 40 index jumped 0.79% to hit a more than one-month high, outperforming major European bourses, aided by a 8% rise in shares of engine maker Safran after the company upped its full-year profit forecasts. The rally followed gains in Asia, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gaining as much as 1.08% to reach its highest since Aug. 2. U.S. stock futures reversed early losses and rose 0.5%. The Chinese yuan jumped versus the dollar in offshore trade, while safe-haven assets such as gold, the Swiss franc, and the yen fell. China's Commerce Ministry said on Thursday its trade team would consult with their U.S. counterparts in mid-September in preparation for negotiations in early October, hinting at progress in reducing trade friction. Both sides agreed to take actual actions to create favourable conditions, the ministry added, without giving more details. ""The general market tone is driven by the announcement of the meeting of high-ranking officials between China and the U.S,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners. ""But this is not a sustained move into risk-on mode as nothing concrete has come out of it yet and investors need to wait to see whether the meeting will happen and what the results from it will be."" BREXIT NEWS ALSO A POSITIVE Adding to the upbeat mood, a parliamentary vote in Britain put the brakes on the nation's no-deal exit from the European Union, Hong Kong withdrew a contentious extradition bill that sparked recent protests in the Chinese-ruled city and weeks of political turmoil in Italy appeared to ease. ""Since yesterday, there has been limited downside in markets because of what happened in Hong Kong, but now the U.S.-China talks are the story,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co in Tokyo. ""It's the same about Brexit, which means less downside risk."" Any sign that Washington and Beijing are closer to scaling back or resolving their trade dispute would lift a significant burden from the global economy, but many analysts believe the two sides are dug in for a longer and costlier battle. Weighing on sentiment was data that showed German industrial orders fell more than expected in July on poor demand from abroad, indicating manufacturers in Europe's biggest economy continue to struggle in the third quarter. In European stocks, Dassault Aviation joined Safran in a sharp rise thanks to upbeat earnings updates. Dassault rose 9%. News of a $5 billion share buyback sent Equinor up 5.8%. UK bank CYBG slumped 19% after saying it expected to increase its provision for legacy payment protection insurance by to 450 million pounds ($552 million). In currency markets, the British pound lost some of its overnight gains on concern that an election is still pending, although Britain might have averted leaving the European Union next month without a transition deal. Lawmakers are hoping to pass a bill that seeks to stop Britain from leaving the European Union on Oct. 31 with no agreement. Against the dollar, the pound fell 0.3% to $1.2211, after jumping 1.4% on Wednesday. Against the offshore yuan, the dollar fell as much as 0.2% to 7.1340 yuan. Spot gold fell 0.6% to $1542.38 per ounce. The dollar rose 0.17% to 106.60 yen and gained 0.3% to 0.9839 Swiss franc. The 10-year German Bund rose more than 1 basis point to -0.66%, away from the record lows of -0.743% touched on Tuesday. Seizing on recent doubts about whether a European Central Bank stimulus package next week can match expectations, other top-rated euro zone yields also increased, , although the rises were small. Having spiralled lower in the past week after agreement was reached on a new coalition government in Rome, Italian yields steadied near their record lows. The 10-year Italian yield was unchanged at 0.826% , close to the record low of 0.803%. The and 30-year Italian bond yields were also little moved in early trade.

464,"A film agreement between the U.S. and China expires today, paving the way for a new round of talks that could mark the first major deal between the two economic giants under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Under the agreement reached by former vice president Joe Biden and Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2012, the quota for U.S. films into China rose to 34 from the previous 20. China's Communist Party-owned newspaper, the Global Times, said the world's second largest economy was likely to raise the quota, and cited experts predicting the addition of a dozen films. Foreign producers will also be getting closer to 40 percent of ticket sales revenues, comparable to what they get in other overseas markets, up from the 25 percent they are getting from China now, the paper added. ""There is a lot of interest on the Chinese side to potentially increase the number of Hollywood films that are represented in the market,"" Aynne Kokas, assistant professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia. The quota was in fact exceeded by six last year, she added. Trump's call with Xi last week when he softened his stance on Taiwan and agreed to honor the longstanding ""one China"" policy also bodes well. ""There is potential to find trade winds on both sides with the renegotiation of the treaty,"" Kokas said. China's cinema ticket sales slowed last year, rising 3.2 percent against the year before to 45.3 billion yuan ($6.6 billion), according to data from box office tracker EntGroup. That compared to nearly 50 percent growth in 2015. Industry players however are still upbeat about the outlook for the East Asian market, which box office is tipped to overtake that in the U.S. as soon as this year. The market is also becoming increasingly important for Hollywood, helping to add $1.8 billion in ticket sales to Hollywood's 20 highest-grossing films in 2016, according to calculations from Reuters. There are also expectations of more Hollywood-China co-productions such as The Great Wall starring Matt Damon to draw Chinese moviegoers. However, whether it would be classified a foreign or domestic film in China is one that only Chinese authorities can decide. ""Within the Chinese domestic context, there is this idea that protecting domestic culture and creating culture domestically is actually a form of national security...Hollywood studios don't think in terms of cultural security or U.S. national interest when making films. They are really just looking to expand their box office, whereas Chinese companies really have a lot more responsibility with regard to what they have to do with that,"" said Kokas.

465,"AUSTIN, Tex. — First, it was picking up a package on the doorstep. Now, it’s a walk in the neighborhood. Those two simple acts have turned sinister in this capital city, as what the authorities said was likely a serial bomber used packages left on doorsteps and tripwires strung along leafy streets to hide and detonate homemade explosives. Four crude bombs have detonated across the city in the span of 16 days. With no suspect and no motive, neither residents nor law enforcement officials know when or where the next explosion might come — particularly after the latest attack on Sunday, when the suspect switched devices and methods, baffling local, state and federal investigators. “It just sort of puts you on edge,” said Thad Holt, 76, who lives about two blocks from the scene of the blast on Sunday that wounded two men. “It puts the whole town on edge.” The need for caution was underlined early Tuesday when a package exploded at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio, injuring one employee. Local and federal law enforcement agencies were trying to determine whether that explosion, in Schertz, Tex., was linked to the four bombings in Austin. [Our article on the explosion at the FedEx facility can be found here.] The four explosions have killed two people and wounded four others since March 2. The first three were package bombings that detonated after the victims handled simple cardboard parcels on their doorsteps in northeast and east Austin. The packages were not mailed, but left near their doors. The fourth device on Sunday appeared to have been triggered by a tripwire set up along a quiet southwest Austin street, igniting a shrapnel-laced explosive that had been partly obscured by a home-for-sale sign, officials and neighbors said. The first three incidents appeared to target those who handled the packages, but the latest one targeted no one specifically, and lay dormant for an unknown period until the two young men tripped the wire. “With this tripwire, this changes things,” Christopher H. Combs, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s San Antonio office, told reporters on Monday. “It’s more sophisticated.” He added, “We don’t know why the bomber is doing this. We don’t know his reasons.” The alarm seemed to ease on Monday near the site of the fourth and latest explosion, as the authorities slowly opened up parts of the upscale neighborhood called Travis Country. Residents had been urged to stay indoors for hours while the area was cleared. And yet, there and elsewhere around Austin, people seemed to keep their eyes trained downward — looking for suspicious bags and backpacks, packages and strands of wire across sidewalks. Residents were divided over how to change their routines, or not, while the explosions were being investigated. Some resolved not to upend their lives, and to continue to order packages and to go on neighborhood walks, while others proceeded warily. “We’re going to be cautious, but I don’t think you can close yourself off from life,” said Charlie Cook, 73, who lives in Travis Country a few blocks from where the bomb exploded on Sunday. “I don’t think we’ll change our lifestyle.” Other residents said they were avoiding opening packages or even answering their front doors out of fear. “Today I ran to the window to make sure it was my postman dropping off the package on the doorstep before I opened the door,” posted one Twitter user, Anton Queer Proseer. Another Twitter user, Lavente McCreary, posted the message, “Literally checking the shipping numbers of all my packages right now to make sure we know when they’re coming. Stay safe, Austin.” For a city of 947,000 that prides itself on a hipster eccentricity and an irreverent live music scene that spawned the local motto, “Keep Austin Weird,” the attacks and their aftermath have been unsettling. The new, subtle fear in places far from the scene of the explosions was that nowhere was safe. The speculation that the first three attacks were hate crimes because two of the victims were black and one was Hispanic seemed to fade as word spread that the two victims on Sunday were white. “This is shocking and horrific and I share the same anxiety and anxiousness that the whole community feels,” Mayor Steve Adler said. “We want this stopped.” More than 500 federal agents are assisting in the investigation, in addition to bomb technicians from the Houston and San Antonio police departments. As of Sunday, investigators were pursuing more than 435 leads that had been called in and had interviewed more than 230 people. Even before the fourth bombing, residents have been on the lookout: Austin officers have responded to 735 calls of suspicious packages since March 12, the day of two back-to-back bombings. Officials said that at about 8:30 p.m. on Sunday, two unidentified men, aged 22 and 23, appeared to have tripped a wire in the 4800 block of Dawn Song Drive in the Travis Country neighborhood. They were either on the sidewalk or on a grassy area between the street and a fence when a device attached to the wire detonated. Both men suffered significant injuries but were in stable condition, the authorities said. The Austin police chief, Brian Manley, said the use of the tripwire suggested “a higher level of sophistication than maybe we initially thought, based on them changing their methods to a more difficult device.” Officials said there were similarities between all four bombs, but they declined to discuss the specifics. They did say that the first three devices were made from commercially available materials and required a level of skill on the part of the bombmaker to avoid an accidental explosion while handling the devices. “We have a high degree of confidence that the same individual built all these devices,” said Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the Houston office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which has made the Austin case its top national priority. Law enforcement officials said they have had no contact with anyone tied to the bombings, despite taking the unusual step on Sunday of publicly asking the suspect or suspects to contact the authorities so they could learn more about the message behind the attacks, hours before the latest explosion. Asked whether the latest bombing was the suspect’s response to that plea, Chief Manley added, “We won’t know that until we have an opportunity to talk to the suspect or the suspects, whether or not that was a motive behind this.” On Monday, law enforcement officials continued to ask for the suspect to contact them. At least one expert on serial bombers and mass murderers cautioned that the suspect may have no motive beyond causing chaos. “I call them vanity bombers,” said Michael Rustigan, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at San Jose State University and an expert on the Unabomber case, in which a former mathematics professor dispatched a string of bombs that killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995. “He’s looking for attention. He’s looking for fame. The bomber might not have a message. The bomber might not be ideological. His motive might be simply to make Austin cringe.” What is known about the construction of the bombs so far appears to be providing few concrete clues, though analysts said the police are most likely analyzing remnants of the devices for fingerprints, DNA or other clues — in addition to scrutinizing any surveillance camera footage. Improvised explosive devices such as those involved in the attacks can vary widely in size, lethality, the type of construction materials used, and means of initiation. The basics of how to make simple I.E.D.s have been in print for decades, with “The Anarchist Cookbook” by William Powell being one of the first to make that information publicly available in 1971. In recent years, similar books have been joined online with advanced bomb-making schematics and recipes for homemade explosives developed and refined by insurgents all over the world — though the bombs described by the police in Austin are not necessarily very advanced or powerful, especially when compared with the devices faced by American troops in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. The four neighborhoods where the explosions have occurred are varied economic and demographic slices of Austin. The first three bomb scenes were in largely working- and middle-class sections of northeast and east Austin, with sizable black, Hispanic and Asian populations. Hammocks and baby swings hang from tree branches on front lawns near Haverford Drive, the site of the first bombing on March 2. The explosion on Sunday took place in a gated and sprawling planned community that is largely white. It is a hilly and wooded area near a patchwork of busy highways and parkways, a favorite among hikers, joggers and walkers. Richard Herrington, 75, a retired pharmacist who lives about a half-mile from the blast site in Travis Country, said he and his family had gone hiking Sunday afternoon near the street where the explosive went off later that evening. “My oldest granddaughter, age 7, said, ‘Grandpa, I want to walk on the street where there’s the most shade,’” Mr. Herrington recalled. “We could have very easily walked down that street because there is shade. We could have been on that street and maybe the tripwire was there already, I don’t know.” At about 8:30 p.m. on Sunday, Mr. Herrington said, he and his wife were watching an N.C.A.A. basketball game. “If you’ve been in the military and you hear a mortar round go off, it has a thump,” said Mr. Herrington, who served in the Army. “And that’s how I knew it was a bomb, because it was a distinctive thump like that. I’m anxious for our community because we don’t know when and where it’s going to happen again. I feel like it will happen again.”"
466,"LONDON (Reuters) - A panel of bankers has ruled that some investors in Thomas Cook’s (TCG.L) credit derivatives worth as much as $2.7 billion are eligible for a payout following the world’s oldest tour operator’s collapse on Monday. The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees (DC) said in a statement posted on its website on Tuesday that its EMEA panel had determined at a meeting on Monday that a bankruptcy credit event had occurred. That ruling by the DC, which is made up of representatives from big banks, means that most holders of Credit Default Swaps (CDS), instruments used to insure exposure to credit, will get paid for their bets against the company. The weekly gross notional value for Thomas Cook’s CDS was $2.69 billion, according to the Depositary Trust & Clearing Corp (DTCC). The ruling applies to credit derivative transactions with a scheduled termination date on or after Sept. 23 and doesn’t apply to transactions with a termination date of Sept. 20, the statement said. The judgment comes after hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers were stranded on Monday by the demise of the company, sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history. The liquidation marks the end of a British company that started in 1841 running local rail excursions and grew to pioneer the family package holiday.

468,"(Reuters) - U.S.-based bicycle manufacturer Kent International has found a way around President Donald Trump’s tariffs - by shifting production out of China. Like almost all U.S. bike makers, Kent has long relied on low-cost Chinese labor and parts, but Trump’s tariffs have so far inflated his costs by about $20 million annually. “We have no choice but to - as rapidly as possible - look to move production away from China,” said Arnold Kamler, chief executive and majority owner of the Parsippany, N.J.-based bike company. But Kent and other bike makers don’t have to move their manufacturing operations to the United States to avoid tariffs - nor do they have to stop using Chinese parts. The company now plans to make bike frames in Cambodia while continuing to buy about half the components it will attach to those frames from producers in China. The resulting bicycles can enter the United States tariff-free because of U.S. rules that generally allow products to be designated as made-in-Cambodia as long as 35 percent of their costs for parts and labor are derived from that country. Gaming the so-called rules of origin is a legal tariff-avoidance strategy being adopted by other major U.S. bike builders and explored across the industry, along with other manufacturing sectors, according to bike executives and supply chain consultants. The shift in the $6 billion bike industry underscores how such rules allow manufacturers, despite tariffs, to continue sourcing large portions of their parts from China, undermining the Trump administration goal of boosting U.S. manufacturing employment. It further shows how quickly light manufacturers with less capital-intensive operations can move to Southeast Asia, which has seen a blitz of new investment since Trump launched his first tariffs last spring. The bike industry plays a small role in what experts call the biggest shake-up in cross-border supply chains since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Companies in an array of industries - furniture, electronics, apparel, tires, vacuum cleaners, to name a few - are moving operations to Vietnam, Thailand and other Asian countries, often while continuing to use some suppliers in China. [L4N1XV1EX] “This is a mid- to long-term issue that is not going to blow over in a year,” said Brett Weaver, a supply-chain consultant at KPMG. “More and more companies are beginning to take that perspective.” The Trump administration’s office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) did not respond to requests for comment. For many companies, tariffs proved the deciding factor in moves already under consideration because of rising labor costs in China. Three decades ago, when Kamler first offshored Kent’s production, labor in China cost him 20 percent less than in the United States. That gap has narrowed to 5 percent, he said. Kent currently sources nearly 90 percent of the 3 million bicycles it sells to Target, Walmart and other U.S. retailers from China. But sales took a hit after it raised prices in response to tariffs last September. Kent’s new factory in Cambodia is estimated to cost $20 million - an amount equivalent to one year of Kent’s increased costs from Trump’s 10 percent tariffs, which were added to existing duties. Trump’s tariffs were set to rise to 25 percent on March 2, but on Sunday he delayed the increase, citing progress in trade talks with China. Another major brand, Specialized Bicycle Components, has moved production from China to Cambodia, Vietnam and Taiwan, expanding its existing Southeast Asia operations, said Bob Margevicius, a vice president of the Morgan Hill, California-based bike maker. Smaller producer Pure Bicycles, based in Los Angeles, is preparing a move to Vietnam, said Michael Fishman, president of the Los Angeles-based firm. Industry officials and supply chain consultants say all American bike-makers are considering similar moves to shield their low-margin businesses from tariffs. “Their supply chains are disrupted,” said Morgan Lommele, a director at PeopleForBikes, an industry association. “They are looking at other countries.” ‘A WAKE-UP CALL’ All manufacturers face challenges in moving their operations to Southeast Asia, including constraints on port capacity and labor. And no country can easily supplant China’s scale and production volumes for bicycles after three decades of the industry migrating there from the United States. In the 1970s, U.S.-based firms made more than 15 million bicycles annually, compared to fewer than 500,000 now, according to the data presented by the industry to the USTR last year. And 94 percent of U.S. bike imports currently come from China, U.S. Census data shows. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ElEW2d) China also provides more than 300 million components such as tires, tubes, seats and handlebars - accounting for about 60 percent total component imports. Specialized finished moving all its production out of China by December but, like Kent, will continue to buy components from there. Trump’s tariffs provided a “wake-up call for the industry,” said Margevicius, who also serves on the board of an industry trade group, the Bicycle Product Suppliers Association. Chinese authorities are keen to protect manufacturing jobs, too. To cushion the impact of tariffs, China has increased export tax rebates and quickened tax refunds to exporters, Margevicius said. It is also offering companies cheap loans. A more than 5 percent decline in the value of the Chinese Yuan last year, along with forecasts of further depreciation this year, are also helping blunt the impact of higher U.S. duties. Kent is, nonetheless, moving ahead with plans to start manufacturing in Cambodia in September, and Kalmer said it will shift the bulk of its production there over the long term. Lower labor costs were a major deciding factor in addition to tariffs, said Kalmer, who remains skeptical that Beijing will sustain its tax incentives to lower-end manufacturers as its economy shifts towards services, consumption and high-tech production. South East Asian countries are also wooing firms exploring options outside China. Cambodia has allowed Kent to bring in short-term workers from China. Thailand is promoting itself as a regional manufacturing hub, offering incentives such as an exemption of up to eight years on corporate income tax for certain industries and exemptions on import duties for some raw materials. Vietnam has finalized 16 free trade agreements including with the European Union and is a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, offering companies almost duty-free access to big bike markets from Germany to Australia. Specialized’s Margevicius advises companies considering a move to look carefully at whether locations outside China have the required infrastructure to meet their needs. Each of the two biggest ports in Vietnam, for instance, has only a sixth of the capacity of the port of Shanghai, and Cambodia lacks a deep-water port to accommodate larger vessels. The rush of manufacturers moving operations to Southeast Asia will also bring new competition to hire and train workers from a labor force far smaller than that of China. Kamler is not deterred. Kent’s Chinese partner has already bought a plot for the Cambodian factory, five miles from downtown Phnom Penh. Construction is scheduled to start next month and finish by June. The company will initially hire and train up to 300 workers to start the production. It will also bring in 100 robots from its Chinese facilities for welding work. “We have a big business in the United States,” Kamler said. “My priority 1,2,3 and 4 is to rescue my USA business.” Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; editing by Joseph White and Brian Thevenot"
469,"A manhunt was underway on Monday for a man suspected of shooting and killing a Missouri police officer during a routine traffic stop on Sunday evening. Gary Michael, 37, a police officer in Clinton, Mo., died at a hospital there shortly after he was shot by a driver he had pulled over at about 10:45 p.m. on Sunday, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said in a statement on Monday. The Highway Patrol identified the suspect as Ian McCarthy, 39. Mr. McCarthy was charged on Monday with one count of first-degree murder and one count of armed criminal action, according to court papers. The Highway Patrol statement said that Officer Michael had been able to return fire but that it was not clear if Mr. McCarthy had been struck or wounded. The police said the suspect lives in Clinton and should be considered armed and dangerous. Gov. Eric Greitens shared a picture of Mr. McCarthy on Facebook and urged Missouri residents to be on the lookout. Sgt. Bill Lowe, a spokesman for the Missouri State Highway Patrol, said Monday evening that investigators believed Mr. McCarthy was still in or around Clinton. He said Mr. McCarthy had lived in Clinton “for a while” but was originally from New Hampshire. Mr. McCarthy had no known relatives in the area and “doesn’t have an employment history,” the sergeant said. “In the recent past we know he was unemployed so there wasn’t anything we can pinpoint that drew him here,” Sergeant Lowe said. He added that investigators were interviewing the suspect’s friends and acquaintances. “We’re getting as much information as possible.” Mr. McCarthy was convicted of first-degree assault in New Hampshire for the June 2001 stabbing of a minor who was left with severe neck, chest and abdomen injuries, according to court records. The Associated Press reported on Monday that Mr. McCarthy was charged with more than 20 crimes in New Hampshire between 1997 and 2011. A warrant for his arrest was issued there in 2013 when he failed to show up for sentencing after he was convicted of disorderly conduct, The A.P. said. Sergeant Lowe said there was also a warrant out for Mr. McCarthy’s arrest in Johnson County, Mo. Court records show that he was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm there in 2015. Officer Michael was a lifelong resident of Clinton, Sergeant Lowe said. He is survived by his wife and two stepsons and had been on the police force for less than a year. “He had a past military background and his desire was to be a police officer,” Sergeant Lowe said. “It just came to the point where he was able to do that.” Before shots were fired, Officer Michael radioed in a description of Mr. McCarthy’s car, a 2008 Dodge Nitro sport utility vehicle, according to a probable cause statement filed with court by Sgt. Greg Martin, an investigator with the Highway Patrol’s Division of Drug and Crime Control. He said the vehicle was registered in the suspect’s name. Sergeant Martin said Mr. McCarthy’s car was abandoned near the scene of the shooting after it hit an embankment. Neighbors reported seeing a man running from the vehicle after the crash, he said. Surveillance video from two convenience stores in Clinton was used to link Mr. McCarthy and the abandoned vehicle, Sergeant Martin said. Video from an Everyday Convenience Store shows Mr. McCarthy driving his car into the store parking lot shortly before Officer Michael was killed, the sergeant wrote. The video shows Mr. McCarthy getting out of the car, entering the store and buying a package of cigar wrappers. The video then shows him leaving the store and stopping to talk with someone — who court papers describe only as “a witness” — before getting back into his car. Sergeant Martin said that witness confirmed that the person who got in the car and drove off was Mr. McCarthy. Video from a second shop, Clinton Convenience Store, shows Mr. McCarthy’s car leaving the parking lot of the Everyday Convenience Store and driving toward the scene of the shooting. It does not record the shooting itself. “At this point, the surveillance footage shows a Clinton Police S.U.V. overtake and activate its lights behind the S.U.V.,” Sergeant Martin wrote. “Both vehicles then leave the view of the camera. The time signature for this footage is consistent with Officer Michael’s murder.”"
470,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrial group 3M Co and Minnesota’s attorney general have agreed to settle a lawsuit over polluted groundwater, with the company agreeing to grant $850 million to the state for groundwater projects, the attorney’s office said on Tuesday. Attorney General Lori Swanson had been seeking at least $5 billion in damages from 3M to help clean up the company’s disposal of industrial chemicals in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area over the past 40 years. The Minnesota-based company said in a statement the grant would enable projects that “support water sustainability” and “improve groundwater recharge” in the Twin Cities. It gave no details of what the projects involved. Swanson had filed the lawsuit in 2010, alleging 3M had dumped millions of pounds of excess toxic chemicals in areas east of St. Paul beginning in the 1950s, causing higher rates of cancer, premature births and lower fertility. The company, based in Maplewood, Minnesota, denied the state’s claims, saying the chemicals posed no health risk at their current levels of exposure and that it had not found any adverse health effects among its employees, who are exposed at higher levels than the general population. The settlement came on the day a jury trial was scheduled to start in the case. Swanson said in a statement she appreciated 3M’s willingness to resolve the matter. The chemicals at issue, called perfluorinated compounds, or PFCs, were made in a 3M plant south-east of St. Paul and used in 3M’s Scotchgard brand products. 3M said it would record a 2018 first-quarter charge of approximately $1.10 to $1.15 per share including legal fees as a result of the settlement. Shares in the company were down 0.6 percent at $235 in extended trading at 2200 GMT. Swanson said the settlement grant only covered damages to natural resources, adding that her office had no jurisdiction to recover damages for personal injuries. According to 3M’s latest financial filing in January, the company still faces at least 24 similar groundwater pollution lawsuits filed in courts across the U.S. Some of those complaints include personal injury and property damage claims. An older generation of PFC compounds, known as PFOA or C-8, commonly used to manufacture non-stick products such as Teflon, has been linked to six illnesses, including testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis and thyroid disease. DuPont and its spin-off Chemours settled some 3,550 personal injury claims arising from C-8 pollution for $671 million last year. Reporting by Tina Bellon; Editing by Tom Brown and James Dalgleish"
471,"WHAT’S GOING ON: It’s been almost exactly 20 years since the release of Arundhati Roy’s first novel, “The God of Small Things,” about a scandal-plagued Indian family, which went on to win the 1997 Booker Prize and spent nearly a year as a New York Times best seller. Roy hasn’t been reclusive since then — she’s protested against the Indian state and written a number of political treatises — but as the years stretched into decades with no second novel in sight, readers could be forgiven for wondering if she was going to be, like Margaret Mitchell or Ralph Ellison, a one-hit wonder. So the arrival at long last of a follow-up, “The Ministry of Utmost Happiness” (new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 7), is being heralded as a bit of a second coming: It appeared on the Book Review’s cover this month, and Roy has been the subject of admiring profiles in India and England and the United States. Not that she embraces the attention. “I was never a person who thought, Now that I’m famous, I’ll go live in London or New York and live the dream,” she told The Guardian. “I’m a social cripple in a cocktail party. My idea of a nightmare is people standing very elegantly dressed in a room with a drink in their hand. I’m just like, urghh!” If the title to “The Ministry of Utmost Happiness” casts it as a kind of mirror image to “The God of Small Things” — here a major bureaucracy, there a minor deity — that may be intentional. Roy hoped to avoid repeating herself with another family novel, she told The Guardian, but still tried to capture her own experiences: “I wanted to write where I’m just drifting around, the way I do in Delhi, in mosques and strange places, as I have all my life. Just delighting in all the crazies and the sweethearts, and the joy in the saddest places, and the unexpectedness of things.” She added: “I never want to walk past anyone; I want to sit down and have a cigarette and say, ‘Hey man, what’s going on? How is it?’ That is, I think, the book.” DANCING WITH THE STARS: The actor and comedian Kevin Hart enters the hardcover nonfiction list right at the top with a vaguely inspirational memoir called “I Can’t Make This Up.” In it, he recalls the time he and a friend considered earning money as exotic dancers. “We went to the bathroom, doused ourselves in baby oil, and changed into our stripper outfits. When we emerged, we looked more like victims of a fraternity prank than hot strippers, plus we’d gotten oil stains all over our bow ties. ... That was the end of my stripper days.”"
472,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Vietnamese bar owner was asked to act in a video prank show by a man wanted for the killing of Kim Jong Nam, the North Korean leader’s half-brother, but declined the offer, a Malaysian court heard on Wednesday. In a sworn statement, the bar owner, identified as Nguyen Bich Thuy, said she then introduced the man to a friend and former colleague, Doan Thi Huong, a woman now facing trial in Malaysia for the killing. Vietnamese Huong is accused with another woman, Siti Aisyah, an Indonesian, of smearing Kim’s face with VX, a lethal nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur international airport on Feb. 13 last year. Defense lawyers say Huong and Siti Aisyah thought they were playing pranks for a reality show and did not know they were poisoning Kim. A man who called himself Li had approached Thuy at her bar in Hanoi in December 2016, Thuy said in her affidavit, presented in court by Huong’s lawyer, Hisyam Teh. Li, who spoke fluent Vietnamese and said he was the child of Vietnamese and Korean parents, told Thuy he was hiring actresses for short films and offered her a role. After she refused, she called Huong, who had previously worked with her at another bar, and asked her to meet Li, Thuy said. “I remembered that Huong loved making films so I introduced Huong to him,” she said in the affidavit made available to reporters after the hearing. Teh submitted Thuy’s affidavit during questioning of Wan Azirul Che Wan Aziz, Malaysia’s lead police investigator on the case. Wan Azirul had earlier admitted he had not sought witnesses in Vietnam to verify Huong’s account to police. Teh accused police officials of being biased in their investigation, saying Wan Azirul could have either traveled to Hanoi himself or obtained assistance from Vietnamese authorities to question Thuy. “Because you did not take these steps...this failure has been prejudicial to the accused’s case,” Teh said. Malaysian police have since identified Li as North Korean Ri Ji Hyon. Ri is among four North Korean men caught on airport cameras fleeing Malaysia on the day of the killing, and Interpol alerts have been issued for their arrest. Defense lawyers have argued the killing was politically motivated, with many key suspects linked to the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, suggesting the women were mere pawns. Kim had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea, and his brother had issued orders for his execution, some South Korean officials have said. Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on North Korea after formally determining that Pyongyang had used VX to assassinate Kim. Reporting by Rozanna Latiff"
473,"Chinese phone giant Huawei punished two employees for tweeting a New Year’s Day greeting from the company’s official Twitter account using an iPhone. In an internal memo seen by Reuters, Huawei corporate senior vice president said “the incident caused damage to the Huawei brand.” As a result, two of the Chinese smartphone manufacturer's employees were demoted one rank and received a monthly cut in pay of 5,000 yuan (approximately $728). One of the employees, Huawei’s digital marketing director, will also see their pay rank frozen for 12 months. The tweet from iPhone incident occurred when the Huawei’s outsourced social media agency, Sapient, experienced virtual private network (VPN) problems with its desktop computer, according to the memo.  Twitter is blocked in China, making a VPN necessary to access the platform in the country. In order to send the New Year’s message at midnight, an iPhone with a roaming SIM card was used to send the tweet. The memo says that “the incident exposed flaws in our processes and management.” Twitter had previously removed the source of a tweet from its website and mobile phone app, although some third-party applications still displayed the info. Just last month, however, the microblogging service brought tweet source data back across the platform. Huawei’s tweet publicly displayed “Twitter from iPhone” below the message thanks to this recent Twitter change. pic.twitter.com/YMTs6LeFMo — sora🏳️‍🌈 (@e3cbf594bbb5f11) January 1, 2019 The “Twitter from iPhone” labelling was roundly mocked on social media. Huawei deleted its original New Year’s message and reposted it, this time with the source displaying “Twitter Media Studio.” The replies to the reposted tweet filled with users posting their screenshots of the “Twitter from iPhone” version. From Huawei’s standpoint, the incident is surely embarrassing. Apple’s iPhone is a major competitor to Huawei’s line of smartphones. However, the response seems over the top, especially when you consider that it was devised as a workaround to deal with an unforeseen technical issue involving a outsourced company. "

It is the latter troupe of shameless, relentless thrusters that occupies us here, the Trump and Kardashian clanships.

475,"Alibaba is planning to launch four new data centers across the world, the Chinese e-commerce giant said on Monday, as it steps up its competition against Amazon and Microsoft in the rapidly-growing cloud computing market. The data centers will be located in Dubai, Tokyo in Japan, Germany and Sydney, Australia. It takes the number of Alibaba Cloud data centers outside of China to eight, with the Chinese technology giant now on nearly every major continent. ""With the addition of those four data centers, it will cover our customers globally,"" Ethan Yu, general manager of Alibaba Cloud Global, told CNBC in a phone interview. In each market, Alibaba Cloud has formed joint ventures (JV) and partnerships. In Dubai, Alibaba has formed a JV with Meraas Holdings called YVOLV. In Germany, Alibaba has partnered with Vodafone to open its first data center in Europe. Alibaba will use Vodafone's data center in order to sell its cloud services. In Japan, a JV with Softbank called SB Cloud Corporation was formed earlier this year. The Sydney data center will come online ""within a few weeks,"" Yu told CNBC. The executive said Alibaba was not disclosing the financial terms of the deals but there are revenue sharing agreements in place. The JV with SoftBank will be 60 percent owned by SoftBank with 40 percent owned by Alibaba, the companies said earlier this year. Alibaba's global expansion is a bid to challenge the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google, who combined control over half of the worldwide cloud market, according to data from Synergy Research Group. Alibaba is much smaller than Amazon Web Services (AWS) which leads the market, but is growing very quickly. In its latest fiscal quarter ended September 30, Alibaba reported revenue from its cloud computing division that increased 130 percent year-on-year to $224 million. This outpaced the growth seen by Microsoft, Google, and Amazon's cloud units. Alibaba's cloud unit has 2.3 million customers of which 651,000 are paying customers. Yu said the company's next milestone is 1 million paying users but offered no timeframe on when this would be achieved. The cloud business is also still unprofitable with the focus still on scaling. ""We are not looking at profitability as the near term goal. For now, our goal is to keep expanding our market leadership and therefore we will continue to make investments and develop that for rapid expansion,"" Yu told CNBC. Alibaba Cloud – also known as Aliyun – has been helped by supportive government regulation in China, which has the development of cloud computing a priority. Domestic players like Alibaba have benefitted while foreign vendors have found it difficult to enter the market. This is a differentiator for Alibaba Cloud and is attractive for international businesses trying to crack the Chinese market. ""We have a strong flavor of China and Asia. We are the true cloud that can provide a global infrastructure to our end users and are connected globally especially in China,"" Yu told CNBC. Alibaba currently has two data center locations in the U.S. and Yu said the company has seen a ""big number"" of customers using cloud services to expand their U.S. footprint. But technology companies are trying to figure out what a Donald Trump presidency means for their business. The president-elect has touted the idea of a 45 percent import tariff on Chinese goods, though it's unclear if this plan will go through. Yu said it's too early to tell what effect Trump's policies will have. ""We will be in a much better position in a few months down the road. For me, a very positive relationship between China and the U.S. will be helpful for all business moving forward. From our perspective, we will focus on our business first,"" Yu said."
476,"FRANKFURT, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Europe’s recent slowdown implies only limited cuts in European Central Bank forecasts, and the current policy strategy should be able to handle this, Irish central bank chief and ECB board seat candidate Philip Lane said on Tuesday. “There’s been a sequence of negative shocks in recent times,” Lane said in a confirmation hearing at the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. “But I think all this is in the neighbourhood of reasonably small adjustments to the forecasts,” Lane said. “The current strategy can cater to limited downside revisions.” Lane will replace Peter Praet on the ECB’s board from June 1 and is almost certain to be appointed by ECB President Mario Draghi as the bank’s next chief economist.

477,"When the forces of intolerance and bigotry prevail, as they have lately in Southern states that passed laws institutionalizing discrimination against gay and transgender Americans, it can be tempting to think they are impervious to argument. There is, however, one thing that lawmakers like those in North Carolina do heed – money. After North Carolina passed a law last month perpetuating discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, PayPal canceled its plans to build a large presence in that state, costing North Carolina 400 jobs at the planned office and countless dollars. Today, Bruce Springsteen, a champion of social justice in his public and personal life, announced that he was canceling a scheduled concert in Greensboro, N.C., on Sunday and will refund tickets. “North Carolina has just passed HB2, which the media are referring to as the ‘bathroom’ law,” he said in a statement. The law, he explained, “dictates which bathrooms transgender people are permitted to use. Just as important, the law also attacks the rights of LGBT citizens to sue when their human rights are violated in the workplace. No other group of North Carolinians faces such a burden.” Mr. Springsteen said the law was “an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress.” He noted that some people and groups in North Carolina were fighting to have the law repealed. “This is a time for me and the band to show solidarity for those freedom fighters,” Mr. Springsteen said, adding: “Some things are more important than a rock show.” He said that this was “the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards.” Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band deserve a huge round of applause, as does Charles Barkley, the basketball great, who has urged the National Basketball Association to move its All-Star Game next year away from Charlotte, N.C., unless the law is repealed. The N.B.A. should do that without hesitation. Remember, the NCAA’s president, Mark Emmert, said he would move the collegiate sports association’s events out of Indiana unless it deleted a similar law, and other business organizations actually did cancel events in Indiana. The law, which was signed by Gov. Mike Pence with great fanfare, was later “fixed” in a foolish and ineffective way, but should simply have been repealed. In South Carolina, the intervention by big companies like BMW and Bridgestone Tire helped force the hands of racists in the state government who had resisted removing the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the state Capitol. Mr. Springsteen is taking to heart the adage that all it takes for evil to prevail is for good people to remain silent. What are others who do business in and with North Carolina waiting for?"

479,"June 11 (Reuters) - Latin American currencies firmed against a steady dollar on Tuesday with Mexico's peso extending gains logged after U.S. President Donald Trump called off punitive tariffs on Mexican goods, while Brazil's real looked set to reverse last session's losses. The dollar steadied as investors focused on the upcoming G20 summit for any progress on the U.S.-China trade war that has weighed on global growth. Trump said he was ready to impose another round of tariffs on Chinese imports if no progress is made in trade talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit later this month. Mexico's peso firmed 0.3% after logging its best day in almost a year on Monday on news that Mexico and United States had struck a migration deal that averted U.S. tariffs of an initial 5% that were set to take effect this week. Washington said tariffs may be revisited if not enough progress is made to stem illegal immigration from Mexico. ""This is unlikely to affect markets in the near term,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. Mexico said Brazil may be one the countries that may need to be brought in to control migration to the United States via the Mexican border as it was among the countries that migrants first reach in their journey north. Brazil's real rose 0.5%, recovering from last session's 0.2% dip on worries over crucial pension reforms. Political tensions were in play after leaked messages published by a news website raised serious questions about the impartiality of Brazil's current justice minister, Sergio Moro, a former judge who sent former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to prison. Lawmakers in Brasilia suggested the controversy would not slow their work on an overhaul of the country's social security system, which the government considers essential to kick-starting an economic recovery. Stocks in Sao Paulo hit their highest in 12 weeks with commodity and energy heavyweights boosting the index on higher iron ore, copper and oil prices. The bounce in prices of copper - Chile's main export - put its currency on course to erase Monday's near 1% decline posted on a surprise 50 basis point rate cut by the central bank late on Friday.

480,"(Adds remarks on quick infrastructure projects, changes dateline, previous OTTAWA) By Nia Williams CALGARY, Alberta, Jan 15 (Reuters) - At least part of the Canadian government’s plans to boost infrastructure spending will focus on projects that can be undertaken quickly, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Friday. It was Morneau’s first nod, following a full week of media appearances across the country, to the idea of getting an early jolt of stimulus from the infrastructure project spending to boost an economy slammed by the continued slide in oil prices. “We are looking to make infrastructure investments that are prudent and responsible, and in cases where we can find prudent, responsible projects that we can embark on quickly, we will do so,” Morneau told a news conference at the University of Calgary after speaking to students earlier. Morneau did not give specific details but one idea floated in The Globe and Mail newspaper this week, citing a senior official, has been to spend on retrofits to improve energy efficiency. These expenditures can get underway more quickly than port expansions, even if such “quick-hit” spending may not yield growth-enhancing productivity boosts. Morneau, part of the Liberal government elected in October, once again declined to say whether he was inclined to go beyond what his party had laid out during the campaign in terms of the level of government spending or deficits. The Liberals had promised to run deficits of up to C$10 billion ($7 billion) a year in the first three years of their mandate and then bring it back to balance by year four. Morneau told an earlier gathering of students at the university that the return to balance should be made possible by economic growth. “We do plan on balancing the budget at the end of four years, and that will, I expect, come through growth in the economy,” Morneau said. He defended the government’s plan to run deficits in the next three years but said it was important to be prudent in spending. In October the Bank of Canada estimated 2.0 percent growth for 2016, but it is expected to revise that down next week. (Reporting by Nia Williams; Writing by Randall Palmer; Editing by Diane Craft)"
481,"SAN FRANCISCO — Goodbye, Yahoo. Hello, Oath. Verizon Communications, the wireless powerhouse that was a cluster of local phone companies when two Stanford University graduate students began compiling the Yahoo web directory in 1994, completed its purchase on Tuesday of Yahoo’s internet business for $4.48 billion. Yahoo, which once had a market value of $125 billion, will be combined with AOL, another faded web pioneer it bought in 2015, into a new division of Verizon called Oath. Oath, headed by AOL’s chief executive, Tim Armstrong, will have about 1.3 billion monthly users, and Verizon hopes to use its range of content and new forms of advertising to attract more viewers and marketers as it competes against Google and Facebook. The company also intends to cut costs, with plans to lay off about 2,100 people, or about 15 percent of Oath’s staff. Oath’s strategy will be to place the same content — whether articles, videos or ads — in multiple locations to reach the widest possible audience, said Marni Walden, the Verizon executive vice president who oversees its global media businesses. “I think of the Oath business almost like a shopping mall,” Ms. Walden said in a phone interview from Yahoo’s Sunnyvale, Calif., headquarters, where she had just addressed employees of the two companies. Nike sells its shoes at Macy’s and Foot Locker, she said. “At each one of those storefronts, you’re getting a different type of customer.” In the case of Oath, that means content from some of its media properties like HuffPost and TechCrunch will soon appear on Yahoo sites and mobile apps, and vice versa. “There is a tremendous opportunity to increase viewership of some of these brands,” Ms. Walden said. Verizon will also start pushing Oath apps onto its wireless phones, either preinstalled or added by representatives at Verizon Wireless stores when customers buy a phone. “You’ll start to see more and more of these experiences — Yahoo sports, finance, news — not just as a preload on the handset, but integrated in a very thoughtful way,” she said. Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, resigned from the company after the deal closed. Although she failed to turn around Yahoo’s long-struggling business, she was well compensated for her five years leading the company, earning $246 million, or an average of $1 million a week, based on the company’s final stock price. During her tenure, Yahoo’s share price more than tripled as the value of its Asian investments soared. Yahoo’s stockholders will retain shares in a new company called Altaba that will own its $52 billion stake in Alibaba Group and its $9 billion stake in Yahoo Japan. “Looking back on my time at Yahoo, we have confronted seemingly insurmountable business challenges, along with many surprise twists and turns,” Ms. Mayer wrote in a farewell note to employees. “Working with you has made my time as C.E.O. nothing short of a privilege.”"

483,"Bangkok Dispatch BANGKOK — The monsoons are no longer lashing Bangkok, in that soggy season when my sons sometimes have to wade through waist-high floods to get to soccer practice. So why did I get soaked last week, as I walked along a major avenue in the Thai capital? The liquid, which soon flooded one of Bangkok’s busiest intersections, came from water cannons aimed at alleviating the smog that has shrouded Bangkok for weeks. Pedestrians squealed as the plumes of water shot into the air. A vendor of coconut ice cream failed to stop his pushcart from careening into a sewer. A rat scurried, then swam. Some of the giant hoses were connected to trucks that only contributed to the bad air afflicting Bangkok. Smoke spewed from the trucks’ exhaust pipes. Officials from Thailand’s Pollution Department estimate that vehicle emissions account for roughly 60 percent of the city’s chemical haze. A decade ago, the Thai capital was a rarity in Asia, a place where the air had gotten cleaner largely because of a ban on the most polluting vehicles. Those days are gone. Earlier this month, Bangkok cracked the list of the top 10 cities with the foulest air on the planet. My sons’ school, like more than 400 across the Thai capital, will be closed on Thursday and Friday because of the smog. Like many Asian megalopolises, which crowd the catalog of the world’s most polluted cities, Bangkok suffers from a toxic amalgam: unchecked industrialization and urbanization, a car-crazy populace and lax regulation. The burning of fallow fields and a dry season with little wind exacerbate the crisis. Even as pollution control monitors say they are eliminating the dirtiest diesel engines, a walk on a Bangkok road can be a choking experience. City buses belch murky smoke. There are too many cars for too few roads, and too little interest in public transportation. “In our society, a car is not just a car,” said Tara Buakamsri, the Thailand country director for Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “It’s a representation of affluence and a symbol of ownership. It will be very hard to get people to give up their cars.” Having lived for many years in China, my family is well acquainted with dirty air. I used to joke that we left Beijing in 2014 as pollution refugees. I had tired of strapping little face masks on our boys just so they could commute to school. On many days they couldn’t play outside at all. The smiling panda patterns on their masks couldn’t disguise the fact that fine particulate matter is particularly corrosive for children’s lungs. The World Health Organization says outdoor air pollution caused 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016, claiming far more lives annually than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. We moved from Beijing to Shanghai just as the air there got worse. A couple of years ago, I didn’t realize that our dishwasher had caught fire and was sending smoke throughout the house because everything was already so murky from the pollution. Then we moved to Bangkok. Like China, Thailand seems to be going through the same cycle: denial of a chronic problem, ineffectual solutions and then a sudden realization that the chemical miasma isn’t going to magically disappear without coordinated policies. For years, Beijing residents spoke of fog rather than smog. When the reality finally hit, the government considered some outlandish ideas, like using giant fans to blow the pollution out of town. Scientists agree that spraying jets of water, especially from polluting trucks, will do little to disperse Bangkok’s smog. “There are some government agencies that want to help decrease the pollution, but maybe this is not the best thing,” said Pralong Dumrongthai, the director general of the Pollution Control Department of Thailand, in a delicate assessment of the water cannon treatment. Nor will other unorthodox methods — like water-spraying drones that have been deployed in recent days in Bangkok — fix the chronic air problem. Even as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand, the head of the military junta that seized control of the country in 2014, played down Bangkok’s pollution, shopkeepers were told they could be liable to up to seven years in prison for hoarding masks. The persistent smog has become a rallying cry for some people in Bangkok, where the aftermath of years of coups, street protests and army crackdowns has made the city seem, at least outwardly, an apolitical place. The current junta has repeatedly postponed national elections — the latest date is set for March 24 — yet there has been little mass outrage expressed about the slow return to a nominal democracy. Years of restrictions on free speech and assembly by the National Council for Peace and Order, as the junta is known, have had their effect, even if young people are eager to cast their first-ever ballots. But the spike in air pollution has been front-page fare here — eclipsing the news trickling out earlier this month about the bodies of two exiled Thai dissidents found by the Mekong River, their abdomens stuffed with concrete blocks. News of the murders was buried in much of the local news media. Instead, editorials demanded answers from the junta about the unhealthy air. In China, pollution became a proxy for discontent that could not be expressed in other ways. People began to question the implicit pact made with their authoritarian leaders: We’ll improve your material life, but don’t question how you are ruled. But what if double-digit growth rates result in a poisoned earth and air? Many Chinese began a national rethink. Here, too, ordinary citizens are criticizing the junta for its slow response to the pollution, even if they might not speak out on other political issues. For all that lures tourists to Bangkok — orchids, cheap massages, mango and sticky rice — this is not a city that pampers its residents. Proper pavements are a rarity. Tangles of power lines dangle dangerously. A profusion of plastic bags chokes canals and ever-expanding trash heaps. Much of the fauna that flourishes, like cockroaches, rats the size of cats and the occasional python snaking in through a toilet, is of the alarming variety. Yet Bangkok’s charms are undeniable. Even in the ugliest agglomeration of concrete, a spray of bougainvillea pushes its way through the cracks. Spirit houses adorned with offerings of red Fanta soda nourish the city’s soul. Dusty ficus trees are wrapped with ribbons, as if their ability to flourish in such a dense urban setting is a gift to the 10 million people who call the metropolitan area home. As I was flying back to Bangkok this month, my heart sank as the plane descended into an ocher haze. It was the same feeling of dread I had when returning to China. In the taxi home, my driver was wearing a mask. He shook his head at the bad air. Almost immediately, we got stuck in traffic. But, like many drivers in Bangkok, he had hung a garland of jasmine on the rearview mirror. The sweet scent mixed with the exhaust fumes. I was home."
484,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators looked into Apple’s mobile payment service and found it was not market dominant but they could review it again if they receive formal complaints, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Monday. In an interview with Reuters, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager also signaled that Google and Amazon would remain very much on her radar until the end of her mandate late next year. Google has been fined a total of 6.8 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in the last 18 months for breaching EU rules. Apple’s mobile payment service Apple Pay, launched in October 2014, is available in 10 EU countries including France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Denmark. Critics say that an NFC chip embedded in the Apple iPhone means that Apple Pay is automatically selected when an iPhone user pays for goods and services, barring rival payment methods. The Danish Competition Authority is investigating the issue, which was brought to its attention by the Danish Consumer Council. Vestager, who has earned a reputation for taking a tough line against companies that breach EU rules and can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company’s global turnover, said she did a preliminary review some time back. “When we were looking at it ... (at) first glance, we couldn’t see Apple being dominant. That doesn’t exclude in the future that we will have a second look. But when we looked some time ago, we didn’t find ... the necessary (evidence) to start a case,” she said. “Obviously if we had official complaints, we would take that seriously because the entire payment market is a very important payment market.” A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. Separately Vestager is reviewing whether Amazon is using merchants’ data illegally to make its own brand products similar to retailers’. She said she has been inundated with data, key to building a case against the U.S. online retailer. “Now we have received not piles, but mountains of data and for us it is a priority to go through that, both from Amazon themselves but also coming in from some of the businesses that they actually host,” she said. “For us, of course it is important to get the starting point right because, if we open a case, in order to be able to proceed with some speed, well then of course we need to get some of the basics right and we are in the process of doing that.” Vestager recently asked Google’s rivals if the internet search engine unfairly demotes local search competitors, raising the possibility of a fourth antitrust case against the company. “Now we ask questions when it comes to local search. This means a lot to many people because you use your phone or your table, you are looking for a place to eat, opening hours, where to go, museums, doctors, all kinds of stuff, and therefore of course it is a very important area, a very important service,” she said. “It could be (a fourth case against Google) but of course we start asking questions without prejudice.” Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Susan Fenton"

486,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The massive wildfire raging in Canada’s oil sands region has forced some thermal projects to shut down steaming operations entirely, taking producers into uncharted territory, as delicate reservoirs that require continuous production could be at risk, analysts said. Six companies have completely shuttered 115,000 barrels per day of thermal operations as a precaution against a wildfire that forced nearly 90,000 residents to evacuate the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray last week. That represents only about five percent of overall production from Alberta’s oil sands, but for the companies involved, it is among the most expensive to restart. At least one company is considering keeping a project shuttered indefinitely in the aftermath of the fire, reflecting how operators have had their hands forced by the blaze, as some were already considering curbing production because of low prices. The technology needed to pump high-pressure steam to unlock bitumen deposits makes production costs expensive for thermal operators. But the costs of idling, and then cranking production back up, is also high, and the process involved in restarting production is delicate, especially for newer projects. Producers that invested billions of dollars in oil sands reservoirs chose to operate at a loss rather than shut barrels in even at the peak of the crude price rout in the first quarter of 2016. Thermal production is expected to take longer to restart than the roughly 900,000 bpd of mining output halted, both because of the steaming and heating processes involved and because some thermal projects are still inaccessible due to the fire. Some companies are unsure as to how they will proceed. Conoco Phillips Canada President Ken Lueers said the company would face a big learning curve on its 30,000 bpd Surmont project, which was evacuated last Wednesday. “The asset is very new, the maximum time we have had steam under the ground is under a year and we don’t know how developed those steam chambers are and how they may or may not have dissipated,” he said, adding Conoco may have to redrill some wells if temperature differences cause steel liners to buckle. The length of time operations are halted and the maturity of the reservoir are crucial for determining how difficult and how costly the restart process is. “For a company that has just started up, the heat injected into the reservoir will be far less than those that have been operating for years. They (the reservoirs) might react differently when they start to go back (online),” said Bernard Leung, a consultant and former oil sands production engineer with Devon Energy. By contrast, Toshi Hirata, President of Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd, which shut down its 5,000 bpd Hangingstone plant last week, said he was confident the reservoir would not be affected because the facility has been steaming for 15 years. However, he suggested Hangingstone may do what was considered unlikely - keep the operation offline for some time because of low global oil prices. Companies are unsure what the exact effect will be on carefully-engineered bitumen reservoirs, which are produced by injecting steam underground through well bores to heat and pressurize tarry bitumen so it can flow through pipelines to the surface. If facilities are offline for three to six months steam could condense into water in the reservoirs, which would have to be pumped out, treated and disposed of before new steaming can begin, industry players said. Other risks include sand collapsing into the reservoir, or engineers struggling to find the right steam pressure needed to optimize bitumen production. “A general number we work off is that there is a three or four-week period where the reservoir can maintain pressure, but every reservoir is different,” said Wood Mackenzie analyst Peter Argiris. “You increase the risk beyond that period.” Operators stop steaming through some wells for up to three weeks at a time during planned maintenance, and last year Cenovus Energy shut down its entire Christina Lake facility as a precaution against forest fires for 11 days. During the last oil price crash in 2008-09 Connacher Oil and Gas was the only company to reduce production, shutting in half its 10,000 bpd Great Divide thermal output for two months. It struggled to hit output targets for years afterwards. Athabasca’s 12,000 bpd facility - also called Hangingstone - shut down on Thursday and is intact but still threatened by the fire, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said on Tuesday. Nexen Energy’s Long Lake facility, which produces 20,000 bpd, Husky Energy’s 30,000 bpd Sunrise plant, and Statoil’s 20,000 bpd Leismer project are also offline.

488,"Stocks on Wall Street fell in light trading on Monday as investors dumped former darlings of the market: real estate companies and utilities. Indexes slumped from the start of trading and remained down throughout the day as investors continued to speculate about when the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates as the economy strengthens. A report earlier in the day showed United States manufacturing picking up. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.30 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,253.85. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 7.07 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,161.20. The Nasdaq composite fell 11.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,300.87. The selling was modest, but broad. Eight of the 11 sectors of the S.&P. 500 closed down for the day. Investors hungry for income-producing assets have been buying utilities and real estate companies for their steady dividends. But those stocks will become less attractive if interest rates and bond yields climb. On Monday, stocks of real estate companies lost 1.8 percent. Utilities shed 1.4 percent. Automakers reported that sales fell slightly in September, as demand for new cars and trucks sputtered. According to Autodata Corporation, sales dropped 0.5 percent to 1.4 million in September — the fourth month this year with year-over-year sales declines. Bucking the downward trend in the market were some stocks involved in the latest of a string of deals. Janus Capital surged $1.69, or 12 percent, to $15.70 after announcing it would merge with a London-based investment company, Henderson Group. The outdoor gear retailer Cabela’s shot up $8.25, or 15 percent, to $63.18 on news it was being bought by Bass Pro Shops for $5.5 billion. The price of oil continued its climb from last week, which normally would help drillers and other energy companies. Benchmark United States crude oil rose 57 cents to close at $48.81 a barrel. In the end, though, even energy companies fell, losing 0.2 percent. Among stocks making big moves, Merrimack Pharmaceuticals slumped 31 cents, or 5 percent, to $6.04. The cancer drug developer announced it would cut almost a quarter of its work force and look for a new chief executive. Federal Realty Investment Trust lost $5.85, or nearly 4 percent, closing at $148.08 for one of the biggest declines in the S.&P. 500. In energy trading, Brent crude, the international standard, rose 65 cents to close at $50.84 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline edged up 1 cent to $1.47 a gallon, heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.55 a gallon and natural gas increased 2 cents to $2.923 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.63 percent from 1.60 percent. The euro fell to $1.1212 from $1.1231 and the dollar rose to 101.59 yen from 101.39 yen."
489,"EditorsNote: Several changes throughout No. 19 Wisconsin held off Nebraska for a 66-62 victory in Big Ten tournament quarterfinal action Friday afternoon in Chicago. The Badgers advance to the semifinals to meet Michigan State on Saturday. The magical run ended for Tim Miles and Nebraska on Friday. Entering the game against fourth-seeded Wisconsin, the Cornhuskers were rolling, having won two games in two days to rekindle some postseason hope around the program. But a final surge from the Badgers, sparked by a D’Mitrik Trice 3-pointer with 58 seconds left in the game, offset Nebraska’s late run. The win sends the Badgers (23-9) to the tournament semifinals where they will take on top-seeded Michigan State on Saturday. The Spartans defeated Ohio State, 77-70, in the first quarterfinal of the day. Trice only scored eight points for Wisconsin, but his two 3-pointers came in about the final five minutes of the game. Those two shots helped the Badgers overcome a poor game from star senior Ethan Happ, who scored only four points and turned the ball over seven times. The four points were the fewest all season for the All-Big Ten first-teamer, who found himself seated on the bench during crunch time. Khalil Iverson and Nate Reuvers each scored 14 points to pace Wisconsin, while Brad Davison and Aleem Ford added 11 points apiece. Wisconsin entered the game averaging 9.3 turnovers a game but gave it away 17 times on Friday, which led to 12 second-chance points for the Cornhuskers. Nebraska senior Glynn Watson Jr. did his best to get the Cornhuskers their third win in three days, scoring 23 points. His fourth 3-pointer of the game pulled Nebraska to within 55-53 with 4:14 to play, but Trice than nailed his critical 3-pointer a few minutes later and the Huskers went cold over the final three minutes. James Palmer Jr. added 15 points for Nebraska (18-16) while Isaiah Roby chipped in 13 points. The Cornhuskers likely needed a run to the conference tournament championship to earn a bid to the NCAA Tournament. Now, the Cornhuskers will wait to see if they land an NIT berth after winning two of three in Chicago. —Field Level Media "
490,"SINGAPORE — China's renewable energy market does not need foreign technology and money said Mark Hutchinson, vice president of APAC power and renewables consulting at global energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. ""Right now, China's renewable energy sector is government driven. Going forward, it will be more economically driven,"" Hutchinson told CNBC at the Asian Clean Energy Summit in Singapore last Wednesday. Many Chinese energy companies receive help from the government in the form of direct investments and large subsidies. But that will likely change soon, Hutchinson said. Although China's growth has slowed, he said, investors need to keep in mind that it's part of the process for maturing economies. ""It's nothing new in China. It's growing slow. But even a 5% to 8% growth in China, in absolute terms, that's still massive,"" he said. According to a Reuters poll published in October, China's third-quarter GDP is expected to grow 6.1%. Reuters reported that China's total renewable power capacity rose 9.5% in the first six months of the year, hitting 750 gigawatts, as Beijing pushed for clean energy consumption as part of its anti-pollution campaign. In the first half of the year, China added 1.82 gigawatts of hydropower capacity, 9.09 gigawatts of wind capacity and 11.4 gigawatts of solar capacity, the National Energy Administration said at a news briefing in early June. Looking ahead, Hutchinson said he believes the main focus for the Chinese government is grid parity, as it tries to encourage more private players to participate. ""They're reducing the subsidies because — the argument that they're making is that, now solar and wind should be competing on their own merits and rather than be subsidized,"" said the energy consultant. But China's renewable sector still does not have much foreign investment because it remains a less predictable operating environment, when compared with neighboring countries, he said. For example, Hutchinson said Thailand has not changed its power purchasing agreement in 20 years, whereas China often changes the rules, with little notice. On top of that, Hutchinson explained that ""the Chinese have their own homegrown technology in wind and solar, so there's little room for foreign players to participate."" These companies also have ""plenty of the liquidity in the banking system."" ""People outside of China often underestimate Chinese companies capabilities in the energy sector... they don't need the financing or the technology,"" said Hutchinson. He said, during his 25 years working in Asia, he's seen a dramatic improvement in Chinese technology in the sector. Source: Wood Mackenzie ""State-owned companies dominate the industry in China. They have good relationships and they're rapidly improving their technology capabilities, and this makes it hard for international and private domestic players to compete... Ten years ago, the tech was bad. Wind turbines were falling off. But now (Chinese companies) are formidable competitors,"" said the consultant. He pointed out that of the world's top wind turbine manufacturers, two out of the top five are Chinese — and about 95% of those turbines are installed domestically. ""Theoretically, there is room for foreigners and international players, but China has the technological capability... China does not need foreigners to build the market,"" said Hutchinson. China is now the world's largest consumer of energy, the largest producer and consumer of coal, and the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, according to think tank China Power. Wood Mackenzie's Hutchinson said his firm sees China's reliance on coal ""peaking in the early 2020s."" ""They're building new plants that are more efficient plants than the old ones. Burning less coal. And we're seeing an increase in gas imports dramatically over the last few years,"" said Hutchinson. China is trying to decarbonize and is now ""putting 30 to 40 gigawatts of renewables out every year... it's a huge amount of power,"" he added. He added that the country is rapidly building out solar and wind farms all across the country. The key issue isn't the efficiency of energy production, rather it is about energy storage, Hutchinson said. He said, without proper battery storage or pump storage, it is unlikely China would be able to store enough energy to provide for the country and fully replace coal. Current storage systems are not sufficient to make coal replacement possible right now. Once the storage shortage is addressed, he said, ""it's not a question of if, but when China will replace coal with renewables. But that is going to be a very long phase out."" ""Because the sun only shines during the day and the wind only blows at certain times. Until you get enough storage through chemical batteries or pump storage, then it will take a long time (to replace coal),"" said Hutchinson. Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that growth tends to slow as economies mature."

492,"The New York Times editorial board is praising New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for her response to a mass shooting in her country, which killed 50 worshippers at two mosques. In an op-ed titled “America Deserves a Leader as Good as Jacinda Ardern,” the board highlighted her swift action in signing a ban on all military-style semiautomatic and automatic weapons and for calling on social media companies to curtail hate speech that spreads on their platforms.  “That attitude stood in stark contrast to the way the National Rifle Association and its political allies in the United States have resisted any restrictions on weapons like the AR-15, the semiautomatic rifle used in several mass killings,” the editorial board wrote. “In New Zealand, it took one mass shooting to awaken the government. In the United States, even a string of mass killings — 26 dead in a school in Newtown, Conn.; 49 in a nightclub in Orlando; 58 at a concert in Las Vegas; 17 in a school in Parkland, Fla. — has not been enough. Nor has the fact that 73 percent of Americans say that more needs to be done to curb gun violence, according to recent polling.”  It also highlighted Ardern’s powerful messages to victims’ families and Muslims across New Zealand. The prime minister vowed that she will fight against racism in the country. “In lieu of trite messages, she donned a black head scarf and led a group of politicians to visit victims’ families; speaking without a script to a school some of the victims attended, she urged the pupils to ‘let New Zealand be a place where there is no tolerance for racism. Ever.’ She told grieving families, 'We cannot know your grief, but we can walk with you at every stage,' ” the editorial board wrote. “After this and any such atrocity, the world’s leaders should unite in clearly condemning racism, sharing in the grief of the victims and stripping the haters of their weapons.

493,"President Donald Trump Monday fired another round in a public feud with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, which has gone on for more than a year. This time Trump criticized Sessions for investigations of two Republican lawmakers that could hurt the party's chances of holding on to their seats in November. The comments were just some of those the president made throughout the day on the social media platform. Earlier, he celebrated Labor Day, criticized a key labor leader, saying he could understand why labor unions are doing so poorly. Then, in the afternoon, he weighed in on a possible presidential bid by former Secretary of State John Kerry. ""Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department,"" Trump tweeted, referring to charges against Trump supporters Reps. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) and Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.). ""Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff."" This is not the first time Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize Sessions. Trump has faulted Sessions for not reining in what Trump has called special counsel Robert Mueller's ""illegal investigation"" into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Sessions fell out of favor with the president after he recused himself from the Russia investigation, which Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" Throughout August, the president's attacks on Sessions have escalated, however, the president recently told Bloomberg News that Sessions will remain in his post until at least the midterm elections in November. Early last month, Collins was charged with securities fraud and lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Although he has denied the allegations, he suspended his reelection campaign in the wake of his arrest. Meanwhile, Hunter and his wife, Margaret Hunter, have been accused of misusing campaign funds and concealing their actions by falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission. In a 48-page indictment, federal prosecutors said that between 2009 and 2016 the couple used more than $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses like a family vacation to Italy, golf outings and expensive meals. Trump followed up his first tweet with a second that speculated that Democrats must ""love"" Sessions now. He also draw comparisons between Sessions and James Comey, who Trump says became more popular with Democrats after he was fired by Trump. Although Trump said that no Democrats had supported Sessions' nomination for attorney general, he received one lone Democratic vote from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). Earlier Monday, Trump took to Twitter to criticize AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, saying the labor leader had ""represented his union poorly on television this weekend .... It is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly."" Trump also commented on the possibility of Kerry launching another bid for president. ""I see that John Kerry, the father of the now terminated Iran deal, is thinking of running for President. I should only be so lucky,"" Trump said. Kerry, who was a 2004 presidential nominee, was asked about his interest in running in 2020. Although he told CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" that talk of who would run for president is a ""distraction,"" the Democrat didn't rule out the possibility."
494,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s jobs boom has weakened in the approach to Brexit with the number of people in work unexpectedly falling by the most in over four years and unemployment rising, official data showed on Tuesday. Employment fell by 56,000 to 32.69 million in the three months to August, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth of 23,000. The number of people out of work rose by 22,000 to just over 1.31 million, the ONS said. Britain’s strong labour market has been the silver lining for the economy since the Brexit referendum in 2016, something many analysts attribute, in part, to firms hiring workers that they can later lay off rather than making longer-term commitments to investment. But there were signs in Tuesday’s figures that employers were turning more cautious. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.9% from a 3.8%, which had been its joint lowest since the mid-1970s, while vacancies fell to their lowest level since the three months to November 2017. “Challenging economic conditions are starting to take the shine off the UK’s job boom,” Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, an employers group, said. “Business leaders’ long-lasting drive to expand their workforce has put the labour market in a strong position. However, firms are now increasingly coming up against uncertainty and the shrinking supply of available talent.” Many employers are worried about Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s pledge to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 without a transition deal to smooth the economic shock if necessary. However, lawmakers have passed legislation that they say will force him to seek a delay from Brussels. A survey published separately on Tuesday by Britain’s main auto industry group showed jobs cuts at one in three firms in the sector, which risks being a big loser from Brexit. That was up from one in eight just under a year ago. As well as worries about Brexit, Britain’s economy is feeling the drag from rising U.S-China trade tensions which have weighed on global growth. The ONS labour market data showed a dip in the pace of pay growth which recently hit its fastest in more than 10 years. Total earnings growth, including bonuses, rose by an annual 3.8% in the three months to August, slowing from 3.9% in the three months to July and weaker than the median forecast of 4.0% in the Reuters poll. Excluding bonuses, which smoothes out some volatility, pay growth similarly slowed slightly to 3.8%, but was a touch ahead of the Reuters poll forecast of 3.7%. The trend in pay growth is being watched closely by the Bank of England. Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said in a newspaper interview published on Sunday that wage costs were “picking up quite significantly, which will drive domestic inflationary pressure.” However, the BoE is waiting for more clarity on Brexit before any decision to resume its gradual and limited programme of interest rates hikes.

Next week, the $2,295 headset will be going up for sale at flagship AT&T stores in Boston, San Francisco and Chicago. Having more channels of distribution than direct-to-consumer orders from the web is obviously good for Magic Leap, and distills some sort of bleeding-edge innovation marketing ethos for AT&T, but as the Magic Leap One appears to be exiting the dev kit phase of its life cycle, what relatively normal person out there is really going to be interested in buying this thing? I think it’s fair to say that there isn’t a great reason to own one of these as a consumer, aside from just exploring a new piece of technology that’s pretty interesting. VR platforms from Oculus and Valve have built up far more robust storefronts, but that’s going to be a big challenge for Magic Leap to do on its own. The company has showcased plenty of brief demos, but there isn’t a huge amount of gaming content for the device, and Magic Leap doesn’t seem to have realized any substantial new consumer hits. At AT&T’s in-store demos, Magic Leap will be showing off a Game of Thrones experience they’ve built with HBO. The enterprise market is perhaps the more realistic sell, and while it would seem like most customers would know whether they want something like this, having the opportunity to take it for a whirl, albeit with some GoT content, might be the added push they need."

498,"Washington (CNN)Tiffany Cabán has conceded the race for the Democratic nomination to be the next district attorney of Queens County, New York, after the race was too close to call following the June election.  Cabán, a young, progressive outsider, ran against Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, who had the backing of most traditional local power brokers, and several other candidates. The results of a manual canvass left Katz with a narrow win. Cabán preached a message of hope in her concession speech on Tuesday night. ""So this election may be over, but the organizing does not stop. It will not stop,"" the candidate said at a party for supporters and volunteers. ""I look forward to continuing the fight alongside y'all, and we are just getting started."" The attorney, who is of Puerto Rican descent and identifies as queer, had hinged her campaign on a promise to effectively decriminalize a series of low-level offenses that law enforcement and prosecutors began cracking down on during the ""tough on crime"" era of the early 1990s. That means refusing to prosecute subway fare beaters, recreational drug-related crimes, resisting-arrest charges -- especially when they are not attached to more serious allegations -- loitering and other offenses, like sex work. Cabán also had pledged to wipe out cash bail, and her long-term goal was to achieve ""population zero"" in the city's prisons.  Cabán had gained serious momentum in her race following endorsements from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, as well as Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.  Had Cabán won, she would have joined a new wave of progressive prosecutors ascending around the country, like Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner and Rachael Rollins in Boston. Both Krasner and Rollins had endorsed Cabán in the weeks leading up to the primary. Katz expressed gratitude to Cabán and called for unity in the Democratic Party heading into the general election. ""I want to thank Tiffany Cabán for bringing closure to this long and hard-fought race,"" Katz told CNN in a statement. ""Too often, the process of primary campaigns obscures the vast commonalities we share as Democrats and reformers. We all want a safe Queens where everyone is treated equally."" "

501,"Washington (CNN)Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried to have his cake and eat it too when it came to his explanations during congressional testimony Tuesday for the firing of FBI Director James Comey. On the one hand, Sessions didn't feel like he needed to stay in the Oval Office on February 14 when President Trump said he wanted to speak privately with Comey. And he didn't feel the need to do anything following a meeting the two men had in the days that followed in which Comey expressed his discomfort with these one-on-one conversations with the president. Sessions' justification in both instances was that Comey was a total pro, that he knew his stuff and that Sessions trusted him to handle his business. ""I felt (Comey), so long in the department -- former deputy attorney general, as I recall -- knew those policies probably a good deal better than I did,"" said Sessions at one point. At another, Sessions said: ""Our Department of Justice rules on proper communications between the department and the White House have been in place for years. Mr. Comey well knew them, I thought and assumed, correctly, that he complied with them."" On the other hand, Sessions told the Senate intelligence committee that he and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had discussed removing Comey as FBI director and agreed that it was time for a ""fresh start"" at the bureau before either man was confirmed to their current positions. Huh? Either Comey was the ultimate pro who could be trusted to handle his business or he was someone who Sessions had decided months before needed to go because he had badly mismanaged his role in the 2016 election. Comey can't simultaneously be highly competent and a bungling, bumbling fool depending on what image suits Sessions' needs at the moment. But, time and again, Sessions tried to hold those totally oppositional thoughts in his head -- and insisted that they weren't at all contradictory.  As Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, noted in Tuesday's hearing, in July and again in October -- following Comey's initial announcement that Hillary Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in her handling of her private email server and his decision to re-open the case in October -- Sessions praised the then FBI director.  This exchange between Reed and Sessions is telling: REED: So, in July and November, Director Comey was doing exactly the right thing. You had no criticism of him. You felt that in fact he was a skilled professional prosecutor. You felt that his last statement in October was fully justified. So how can you go from those statements to agreeing with Mr. Rosenstein and then asking the President, or recommending he be fired? SESSIONS: I think, in retrospect, as all of us begin to look at that clearly and talk about it, as perspectives of the Department of Justice, once the director had first got involved and embroiled in a public discussion of this investigation, which would have been better never to have been discussed publicly, and said he -- it was over. Then when he found new evidence that came up, I think he probably was required to tell Congress that it wasn't over, that new evidence had been developed. Uh, what? If you get what Sessions is driving at in his response to Reed, you are a better -- and smarter -- person than me.  (Also worth noting: Comey testified, under oath, that Trump called him several times in the first part of this year to tell him how great a job he was doing.) Then there was the fact, revealed in Sessions' testimony yesterday, that he had never met with Comey to discuss what he took to be his poor performance.   This back and forth with Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the vice chairman of the intelligence committee, gets at that oddity: WARNER: So you were his -- his superior, and there were some fairly harsh things said about Director Comey. You never thought it was appropriate to raise those concerns before he was actually terminated by the President? SESSIONS: I did not do so. A memorandum was prepared by the deputy attorney general, who evaluated his performance and noted some serious problems with it.  Take one giant step back. We know, because Donald Trump told us, that the real reason he fired Comey was because of the former FBI director's approach to the Russia investigation. Trump said that after his administration had tried to sell the same case Sessions was selling on Tuesday: That Comey was removed because of a memo from Rosenstein. That's the fact. Everything else -- including Sessions' attempts to spin his views on Comey and the circumstances surrounding his firing -- are simply post-action spin. "
502,"IN 2011 JOHN COCHRANE, a professor at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, gave a presidential address on “Discount Rates” to the American Finance Association. It was published as a paper a few months later. In a sweeping take, Mr Cochrane set out how academics’ understanding of the way asset prices are determined has shifted over the past half-century. Many papers are described as “landmark”; this one has a better claim to the label than most. His opening line (“Asset prices should equal expected discounted cash flows”) indicated that the basic premise has not changed. But plenty has. In the 1970s the focus of academic finance was on the “expected” part of that equation—the efficiency with which markets priced in any new information relevant to future cash flows. The emphasis has shifted. The “discounted” part, or the risk preferences of investors, has become the main organising principle for research, argued Mr Cochrane. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. The old-school view was that when stock prices are high relative to earnings or dividends (ie, yields are low), it implies these cash flows are expected to grow quickly in future. The new school says it is changes in risk appetite—the discount rate that investors apply to future earnings—that explains much of the variation in asset prices. If prices are high and yields are low, that implies investors are willing to accept lower returns in future. Yields predict returns. There are practical implications. A generation ago an investor might have looked to history for a guide to expected returns. Now yields are seen as a more useful steer. This is clearer with government bonds. The real annual return on American Treasury bonds was 1.9% between 1900 and 2018, according to Credit Suisse’s Global Investment Returns Yearbook. But history is bunk. It would not be wise to expect a 1.9% return when the yield-to-maturity on inflation-protected Treasury bonds is zero, as it is now. The future cash flows from stocks are not as certain as those from government bonds. But Mr Cochrane argued that a similar principle holds with stocks over the long haul. “High prices, relative to dividends, have reliably preceded many years of poor returns. Low prices have preceded high returns,” he said. The predictive power of yields holds for bonds and stocks, but also for other assets, such as housing. And valuations based on aggregate earnings or book value predict stock returns just as well as the dividend yield. A lot of people prefer the earnings yield. Share buy-backs have become a more popular way to return capital to stockholders than paying dividends. The earnings yield may be a better guide to expected returns. True, not all company earnings are distributed to shareholders in dividends or buy-backs; some are used to pay for investment to generate future earnings growth. On the other hand, that growth should also be considered part of expected returns. If yields predict returns, that might seem to imply that astute investors can sell stocks when yields (and expected returns) are low and buy them back when yields are high. In practice, the signal from yield is too weak to be relied upon to catch turning points profitably. But what matters to a lot of investors is not so much what stocks will return in the short run, but how much extra they will return over safe bonds in the long run. This extra reward is the equity risk premium—and to Mr Cochrane’s way of thinking the discount rate, the risk premium and the expected return on equities “are all the same thing”. One forward-looking measure of the equity risk premium shows a wide variation over time (see chart). Investors with a long-term horizon might profitably use such variations to decide on the mix of risky stocks and safe bonds to hold in a portfolio. The higher the risk premium on stocks, the more the odds favour investors tilting their portfolio away from bonds. A question for academic research is why exactly expected returns (or, if you prefer, discount rates) on stocks vary so much. One explanation is that, as memories of the previous market crash fade, people get more comfortable owning equities—until the next bear market makes them rethink. In his address Mr Cochrane argued that in a market slump a typical investor is inclined to ignore the high premiums offered by stocks because he fears for his job. The correlation between employment income and stock prices is to blame. Future returns are remarkably hard to predict. Yields may only be a weak guide to them; but they are the best we have.■"
503,"Juul's decision to halt the sales of most of its flavors will not deter the Trump administration's plans to remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told CNBC. Juul last week said it would discontinue online sales of its fruit, creme, mango and cucumber nicotine pods. The market-leading e-cigarette company halted sales of these flavors in bricks-and-mortar stores last fall amid pressure from the Food and Drug Administration. ""We want anything that's attractive to kids to not be available for kids,"" Azar said in response to Juul's announcement in an interview. ""It doesn't stop what the president and I are working on."" Azar and acting Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Ned Sharpless last month said the Trump administration was readying a plan to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from the market while the FDA reviews them. The flavors could make their way back on store shelves once the FDA clears them for sale. Azar and Sharpless, who at the time said the plan would be released within weeks, haven't provided more details since the announcement. Now more than a month later, the administration has yet to share any details. At the time, administration officials said their plan would remove mint and menthol products, leaving just tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes on the market. Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said Thursday that the administration is ""hard at work"" on the flavor ban. ""It's one of the reasons why I need to get back to the office after this talk,"" he said at the Food and Drug Law Institute's Tobacco and Nicotine Products Regulation and Policy Conference in Washington, D.C. ""And I cannot talk publicly about any of those internal deliberations other than to say more details to follow as soon as that guidance document is released."" A week ago, Juul said it would keep selling its mint and menthol flavors, for now at least. The announcement cast doubt on whether the administration would follow through with including these flavors in its impending policy. Menthol is a longtime battleground between the tobacco industry and the public health community. Menthol cools the throat, masking the harshness of cigarette smoke and making it easier for young people to start smoking. More than half of minors between the ages of 12 and 17 who smoke use menthol cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The landmark 2009 Tobacco Control Act banned all flavors from cigarettes — except menthol and tobacco. Lawmakers exempted menthol after intense lobbying. The law directed the FDA to study menthol, and the agency's own research has found evidence that menthol encourages minors to start smoking. The FDA is looking at how to address tobacco flavors, including a possible ban on menthol cigarettes. The agency published a proposed rule last year that's received more than 500,000 comments so far. The battle over menthol has extended to e-cigarettes. Among high school students who vape, mint and menthol was the second-most popular flavor behind fruit, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey. Public health groups swiftly criticized Juul's decision to keep selling mint and menthol. ""Juul knows that nearly two-thirds of high school students who use e-cigarettes now use mint or menthol flavors, which is driving Juul's bottom line,"" Michael Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor who has poured $160 million into banning flavored e-cigarettes, said in a statement. Nontobacco flavors, including mint and menthol, account for 80% of Juul's U.S. sales, according to a person familiar with the company's finances who asked not to be named because the information is private. The flavors Juul discontinued this week accounted for 10% of Juul's U.S. sales, down from 50% last year when the company pulled them from stores. Company spokesman Austin Finan said Juul will continue to review its policies and practices ahead of the FDA's guidance and has not made any final decisions. The company said it is not lobbying the Trump administration on the matter and ""will fully support and comply with the final policy when effective."" Groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids used Juul's announcement to urge the Trump administration to include mint and menthol in its policy. FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said the agency plans to share more on the specific details of the plan and its implementation soon."
504,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s newly installed governor and its Senate president faced off on Tuesday in written arguments submitted to the island’s supreme court, which will decide who is in charge of the bankrupt government. Both sides agreed that Puerto Rico is facing its biggest constitutional crisis after days of protests forced Governor Ricardo Rossello to leave office on Friday. Pedro Pierluisi, Rossello’s handpicked successor, is fighting a constitutional challenge filed by Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz over Pierluisi’s appointment as secretary of state, a position next in line to the governor. Pierluisi was sworn in as governor on Friday after the Puerto Rico House confirmed him as secretary of state, without confirmation from the Senate. On Sunday, Schatz filed a lawsuit claiming his chamber’s advice and consent duty under the island’s constitution was usurped and Pierluisi should be removed from office. It was unclear if the Supreme Court would schedule oral arguments in the case, although a ruling was widely expected to be issued soon given the political turmoil. Pierluisi’s legal brief warned that if the high court decides in favor of the Senate, “it would have a disastrous impact on Puerto Rico’s governance,” and jeopardize the island’s stability. The governor’s lawyers argued that Pierluisi was legally secretary of state even without confirmation because the legislature was not in session. Under normal circumstances, an appointment made during a legislative recess would be subject to a legislative vote once lawmakers reconvene for their regular session. However, the fact that Pierluisi ceased being secretary of state once he was sworn in as governor makes that requirement moot, the brief stated.   The Senate president’s brief argued that both legislative chambers need to confirm a secretary of state nominee under Puerto Rico’s constitution. Puerto Rico’s Justice Secretary Wanda Vazquez, another Rossello appointee, would be next in line for governor should the court rule against Pierluisi. At a Tuesday press conference, Pierluisi assured the public that “the government continues to function.”   His assumption of office capped more than a week of political chaos after Rossello said he would resign over offensive chat messages that drew around a third of the island’s 3.2 million people to the streets in protest as well as federal corruption charges against two former members of his administration. Pierluisi has been controversial mainly because he formerly gave legal advice to the island’s unpopular, federally created fiscal oversight board. Reporting By Luis Valentin Ortiz in San Juan.

505," (CNN)President Donald Trump's reputation for bending truth for political ends and conflicting administration rationales for taking out Iran's top general are stirring a new debate over intelligence with troubling echoes in recent history. Administration officials are tying themselves in knots to avoid contradicting Trump's statement that Qasem Soleimani was planning attacks on four US embassies and that the President was therefore justified in ordering his killing. Lawmakers say the hugely significant claim was not included in briefings on Capitol Hill last week by the administration to explain the Soleimani strike amid a fast widening controversy over whether its risks were justified. Given the serious nature of Trump's claim, arguments that intelligence surrounding the attack is too sensitive to be released is unlikely to quell the controversy. Discord over the rationale for the Soleimani attack is awakening history's ghosts of US foreign interventions that went bad after questionable rationales for war -- for instance in Iraq -- as well as contemporary questions about this administration's attitude toward trust and truth. Few politicians in Washington doubt the Iranian military chief posed a threat to the US and had American blood on his hands. But the growing controversy is still deepening criticism of Trump's decision to eliminate Iran's second-most senior leader and debate about whether the possible consequences of escalation with Iran justify the risk. It's also a fresh sign of disarray in the administration's national security leadership that was borne out by repeated contradictions and confusion during the clash over the details of Iran's reprisals and in the aftermath. From the White House's point of view, the controversy risks further fogging an already imprecise narrative about the Iran showdown, exacerbating anger among some Capitol Hill Republicans and highlighting Trump's temperament in an election year. New uproar over Trump's view of his expansive authority as commander-in-chief and refusal to act transparently comes as Washington is about to turn its focus back to an impeachment caused by those very character traits. And less than two decades after wrongly interpreted intelligence led the United States into a war with Iraq that cost thousands of American lives and killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, it poses the question of whether the United States is being drawn into a conflict with Iran on a similar premise. 'Four embassies' The latest controversy over the Soleimani attack began after Trump told Laura Ingraham on Fox News on Friday night that ""I can reveal that I believe it probably would've been four embassies.""   The Trump administration had previously said that Soleimani was planning ""imminent"" attacks on US targets before he was killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad, but could not say when and where they might occur. Two top members of Trump's war cabinet, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and national security adviser Robert O'Brien struggled to navigate the President's remark in a flurry of Sunday talk show appearances. Trump's comment raised the question of whether he was revealing new intelligence that would significantly strengthen the rationale for Soleimani's death and suggest Tehran was preparing a massive attack on the US. Or was he indulging his habit of dispensing misinformation and fabrications and misrepresenting intelligence to justify the most significant and potentially inflammatory national security decision of his presidency? The struggles of O'Brien and Esper on Sunday suggest the latter. On CBS ""Face the Nation"" the Pentagon chief was asked whether there was intelligence to support Trump's claim. ""I didn't see one with regard to four embassies,"" Esper said. ""What I'm saying is, I share the President's view that probably -- my expectation was they were going to go after our embassies."" But in a later Sunday interview with CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Esper said he would not talk about intelligence, possibly in an attempt to avoid coming across as seriously at odds with the President on the question of Soleimani. On ""Fox News Sunday"" O'Brien also struggled to reconcile Trump's words with intelligence made available to members of Congress. He said the President's comment was ""consistent with the intelligence to assume that they would have hit embassies in at least four countries."" ""We knew that there were threats to American facilities -- now whether they were bases, embassies, you know, it's always hard until the attack happens,"" O'Brien said.  On Thursday, officials said when asked about a previous claim by the President that Iran was looking to blow up the US embassy in Baghdad, that he was referring to the storming of the compound that had already occurred. But later on, a senior defense official told reporters that there had been a plot to attack the embassy involving explosives in one of the multiple plans Soleimani was allegedly working on.  Administration 'exaggerating' intelligence Democrats are seizing on the confusion and conflicting statements to accuse the President of misleading Americans. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" Sunday he could not recall any mention of purported attacks being planned on four US embassies during a briefing for the select ""Gang of Eight"" congressional leaders last week. ""The brief was much more along the lines, frankly, of something that Secretary (Mike) Pompeo admitted the other day when he said that we don't know precisely where and we don't know precisely when,"" Schiff said. ""I think what they are doing is they are overstating and exaggerating what the intelligence shows. And when you're talking about justifying acts that might bring us into warfare with Iran, that's a dangerous thing to do."" Sen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day"" Monday that the administration has not offered ""a shred of information that there was an imminent threat."" ""And that's important, John, because imminent threats justify the use of force in a way that 'probably' or 'could have' does not,"" the Connecticut Democrat said. And Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said on ""State of the Union"" that he and colleagues could not recall information about possible attacks on four US embassies being included in an expanded briefing for all members of Congress. And he defended his stark criticism of Trump that is unusual from a party that has stuck with the turbulent President through almost everything. ""We were lied to about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We were lied to for a couple of decades about what was happening in Afghanistan. We have been lied to about a lot of things,"" Lee told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""It's not to say that the government is always lying or that the people who run it are inherently evil. It's just that they're human. And these things do happen. And so that's important to ask these questions, to make sure that we know the details."" CNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report."
506,"News Analysis WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s diplomatic darts this week flew as fast at friends as they did at foes. First, on Monday, came the end of permissions for important partner nations to buy Iranian oil without fear of American sanctions. Then, on Tuesday, American officials wrestled with allies over a United Nations measure on combating rape during wartime. And on Friday, President Trump announced he was “taking our signature back” from a global treaty on conventional arms sales that went into effect in 2014. All of that, along with a shift last week on Cuba policy that angered European leaders, has reinforced the notion that the United States is becoming a rogue superpower as it continues to embrace unpredictable “me first” actions, with little care about upending the traditional world order. The behavior also prompts new questions over whether the Trump administration is sacrificing what should be long-term priorities — namely, countering China and Russia as outlined in the National Security Strategy — for short-term obsessions with much weaker nations that pose no real threat to the United States, notably Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. The relentless drive of Mr. Trump and his top foreign policy officials to pressure smaller nations has inflamed allies. The damage to relations will be difficult to repair even after Mr. Trump leaves office, diplomats warn, because of rising rancor and a huge erosion of trust that could lead allies to strengthen ties with other powers. “You have a bad combination of unilateralism and narcissism,” said William J. Burns, a deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration and a 33-year foreign service veteran who wrote in a new book about the decline of diplomacy under Mr. Trump. “We’re digging a hole for ourselves,” Mr. Burns said. “It’s not like the rest of the world is going to sit by while we get our act together. So rivals take advantage. Allies start to lose faith and hedge.” From Mr. Trump’s perspective, the United States is tackling global issues in a realistic manner with his “America First” approach — working with allies so long as it benefits American interests. “Our mission is to champion the American way of life,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told State Department employees on Friday. But in one notable example, the United States risks the cooperation of Turkey, South Korea, Japan and India on critical security issues by expanding its ban on Iranian oil exports worldwide. Trump administration officials want to coordinate with India to counterbalance China, by far the greatest challenger to American supremacy. The United States is also working with South Korea and Japan to deal with both China and North Korea, which, unlike Iran, has a growing nuclear arsenal. And Turkey, a fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, is a key partner in the effort to bring stability to Syria. American officials are also in negotiations with Turkey to keep it from growing too close to Russia after its decision to buy a missile defense system from Moscow. “Turkey rejects unilateral sanctions and impositions on how to conduct relations with neighbors,” the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said Monday on Twitter of the Iran oil decision. Turkey is looking to continue buying Iranian oil even after its exemption from the sanctions ends on May 2. The moves this month have strained relations well beyond the pain inflicted by Mr. Trump’s repeated denunciations of NATO allies and his withdrawals in 2017 from the global Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The backlash is evident in growing resistance among European allies to American requests to reject technology from the Chinese company Huawei in next-generation 5G telecommunications networks. Meanwhile, officials from more than 150 nations are in Beijing for a conference on China’s global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative. The Trump administration has done little to assuage European allies already on edge. Mr. Trump lifted longstanding limits on American citizens suing over property that had been confiscated by the Cuban government after the Communist revolution. European officials strongly objected — and threatened to sue the United States at the World Trade Organization — over concerns the shift would harm foreign companies with ties to Cuba. Administration officials threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by Germany, that sought to combat the use of rape as a weapon of war. The officials demanded the measure be stripped of language on reproductive and sexual health. Several top American officials are evangelical Christians, including Mr. Pompeo, and have taken strong stands on issues related to abortion. The Security Council approved the resolution on Tuesday in a significantly weakened form. “The current president doesn’t care about the West,” the retiring French ambassador to the United States, Gérard Araud, said in an interview with Foreign Policy magazine. “He is a nationalist. He is America alone.” Latin American countries also are angered by the United States’ increasing intractability, even as China tries to make inroads into the Western Hemisphere. The State Department is planning to cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of what Mr. Trump has called failures to stem migration to the United States. That has weakened American warnings about doing business with China and demands that Guatemala and Honduras continue to recognize the self-governing island of Taiwan rather than China. (El Salvador already switched recognition last year, prompting a rebuke from Washington.) But nothing has strained relations between the United States and other nations more than the anti-Iran campaign led by Mr. Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser. World powers that entered the Iran nuclear deal with the United States in 2015 objected to Mr. Trump’s withdrawal last year and the American sanctions that were later imposed. European nations have created a financial transaction system to continue doing business with Iran. Iraqi leaders are defying American demands that they stop buying natural gas and electricity from Iran and cut ties with Iranian military officials. Iraq and the United States partnered in the fight against the Islamic State, an effort that was paralleled by Iran, which is an ally of Baghdad. In India, officials were surprised and disappointed by the reversal on the Iranian oil purchase waivers, citing earlier assurances by Washington they would be allowed to continue buying the oil. A senior Indian official noted that New Delhi had shown loyalty to Washington. It was weighing ending all oil imports from Venezuela — not because it agreed with the Trump administration’s hard-line position on Venezuela, but because India considers the United States a strategic partner. The Indian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also expressed disappointment in the Trump administration’s decision in March to remove India from a trade program that gave the country tariff-free access to the United States. The Americans did the same to Turkey. Mr. Trump’s aggressive approach to trade has irritated other partner nations, including Canada, France and Japan. “You have a big stick, and you don’t care who your interlocutor is,” Mr. Araud said. “You treat China the same way you treat the U.K. or the European Union.” Both South Korea and Japan have endured rounds of bilateral trade negotiations with the United States. And both also asked the United States not to end the Iranian oil waivers, as did China, Iran’s biggest customer. The United States needs help from those three nations to pressure North Korea to give up its dozens of nuclear weapons. Iran has no nuclear weapons and is not yet moving to develop any, according to American intelligence assessments. “These decisions probably won’t torpedo those relationships, but they will add to an already long list of bilateral irritants at a time when we need unity,” said Kelly Magsamen, who was the Pentagon’s top Asia-Pacific policy official at the end of the Obama administration. “The biggest problem is that America is no longer consistent,” she said. Mr. Burns, the former American diplomat, said Mr. Trump would do well to remember that the United States is no longer the world’s singular dominant player. That, he said, has raised the significance of global alliances and working with coalitions of countries. “We have a window before us within which we can help reshape those institutions and that order before it gets reshaped for us by the rise of other powers and other events,” Mr. Burns said. “The problem is that window is not going to stay open forever.”"
507,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Myanmar’s highest court ruled against two Reuters reporters on Tuesday, upholding their conviction for violating a state secrets law after they uncovered a military massacre. The two reporters, U Wa Lone, 33, and U Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, were sentenced in September to seven years in prison under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act for receiving documents from a police officer. They have been imprisoned for 16 months, drawing international condemnation by human rights groups and media organizations. Their defense lawyers argued that the evidence in the case was planted by the police and that the rolled-up papers they were handed contained information that was already public. The reporters testified at trial that they were arrested so quickly that they never had a chance to look at the documents. “Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo did not commit any crime, nor was there any proof that they did,” Gail Gove, Reuters’ chief counsel, said after the Supreme Court ruling was announced. “Instead, they were victims of a police setup to silence their truthful reporting. We will continue to do all we can to free them as soon as possible.” Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo have been widely praised for their work in uncovering the massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslim villagers who were fatally shot by soldiers and villagers in September 2017 in Inn Din village in Rakhine State. They were among the Reuters journalists awarded the Pulitzer Prize this month for international reporting. Arrested in December 2017, they have been in prison ever since. In Myanmar, the military and civilian leaders share power under a constitution imposed by the military. Many people in Myanmar and around the world had hoped that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace laureate who became the country’s de facto civilian leader, would promote democracy and free speech. But instead, she has often allied herself with the military, which carried out what the United Nations has called a genocide of the Rohingya people, killing thousands, burning villages, raping women and girls and forcing more than 750,000 to flee across the border into Bangladesh, where they now live in refugee camps. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has had numerous opportunities to free the two journalists but has refused all entreaties. Her attorney general, Htun Htun Oo, oversaw the prosecution of the case, which human rights advocates argued should have been dropped. This month, the country’s president, Win Myint, pardoned almost 10,000 prisoners, but Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo were not among them. “Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo should never have been arrested, much less prosecuted, for doing their jobs as investigative journalists,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. “That they are still in prison shows just how wrong Myanmar’s democracy under Aung San Suu Kyi is going.” Chit Su Win, the wife of Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo, said she had hoped that the Supreme Court would at least reduce the prison sentences of her husband and Mr. Wa Lone. “I’m very disappointed with the decision,” she said. Their lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said they would seek a pardon from Mr. Win Myint. But since he was handpicked by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and reports to her, any decision to free the reporters would almost certainly rest with her. “Myanmar has a very weak judicial system for freedom of press and human rights,” Mr. Khin Maung Zaw said."

After a months long feature by feature cloning of Snapchat, Instagram's finally gets Snapchat's most iconic feature - the lenses, or as Instagram calls them ""face filters."" There are only eight filters for now, but Instagram is soon likely to have its own wide array of filters.  Facebook Messenger has an all new home screen. It now contains tabs for Messages, people who are “Active now"" or online, and favorite groups. There’s also a new bottom bar for Home, Calls, Camera, People and Games. The Camera is a much more prominent part of Messenger than before, likely due to the Messenger Day feature.   The ride-hailing service announced on Tuesday that its Android app will now allow users to easily access real-time public transportation data. This means that you can easily plan trips like taking an Uber to the train station and coordinating your train times. Uber is partnering with Transit to provide the directions.

Medium launched professionally produced audio content, the first exclusive feature for paying members. Finally, you'll soon be able to have YouTube parties in VR. "
510,"Donald Trump's pick for secretary of State boasts investments in Chinese and Russian firms among his almost $500 million in total assets, documents show. NBC News obtained a copy of Rex Tillerson's Public Financial Disclosure Report that was submitted as part of the vetting process for the Exxon Mobil CEO and chairman's nomination to the role. It details Tillerson's financial holdings — including numerous stock holdings in U.S., European and Asian companies. He holds from $109,000 to $361,000 worth of stock in Chinese companies — telecommunications, cement, and shipping firms, plus household names like Alibaba and Baidu. He also has a small stake — from $1-$15,000 worth of stock — in the Russian internet company Yandex, a stock commonly held by Westerners that is traded on NASDAQ. Tillerson's stock holdings in Chinese and Russian companies are all $50,000 and under. His largest holdings overall are in Exxon stock and financial instruments including mutual funds and indexed funds. In total, Tillerson has at least $200 million in Exxon-related holdings. In addition, Tillerson has large holdings in Texas municipal bonds. He and his wife, Renda St. Clair, jointly own a large horse ranch in Texas that is valued at as much as $25 million. They also have real estate holdings elsewhere in the state. Using the maximum value for the holdings published, Tillerson's total assets would be close to half a billion dollars. His holdings rival those of former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who liquidated his own holdings of more than $500 million before taking on that role in 2006. Tillerson will likely have to divest some of his direct holdings in stock like Exxon. However, due to a tax provision created in the Bush administration for people nominated for an executive branch position, Tillerson can take those holdings and invest them for three years in a ""permitted property."" That means his tax hit would be negligible to non-existent. In addition, Exxon Mobil's board has reached an agreement with Tillerson for vesting his pension in a fashion that his lawyers say won't violate ethics rules. An issue over deferred compensation had required him staying with the firm through March."
511,"If ever there was a ""wrong war at the wrong time,"" the transatlantic trade conflict that's boiling this summer defines it. President Trump's own National Security Strategy describes the primary U.S. challenge as major power competition with authoritarian China and Russia. Yet the world's leading democracies instead could be locked in a series of morale-sapping, growth-slowing and politically polarizing skirmishes. The dangers are unfolding over several fronts – Airbus-Boeing aeronautics, new French (and soon British) taxes on U.S. digital giants, potential sanctions against the North Stream 2 gas pipeline suppliers and new tariffs on European car imports. Given political will and leadership attention, these disputes could be avoided. European Union and U.S. officials could negotiate the Airbus-Boeing dispute bilaterally. The OECD could accelerate ongoing talks on the tech taxes. Germany could head off North Stream sanctions by getting a Russian commitment to still transit gas through Ukraine. Auto tariffs could be managed in new trade and investment talks. Deal-maker-in-chief Trump should direct his negotiators not only to settle these potential disputes but at the same time revive the transatlantic talks, known as TTIP, which were dropped early in his administration. The logic is compelling given that China is the more significant trade offender. More to the point, the North American-European economy still is the largest and most prosperous economic bloc in the world, accounting for a third of global GDP in terms of purchasing power and generating up to 16 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. The U.S. and Europe account for 64% of global outbound foreign direct investment and 51% of global personal consumption. What's been lost in the more transactional, tariff-focused Trump administration is the centrality of the transatlantic economic space as the world's most important both in setting global rules and, more often than not, playing by them. Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a Trump move to acknowledge and act on this would also allow him to counteract the most persuasive criticism of his foreign policy, namely that he is alienating allies without yet showing wins on four significant fronts regarding rivals: China and its unfair trade, Iran and its malign behavior, North Korea's nuclear proliferation and Venezuela's despotic dictatorship. ""If you were to do a cost-benefit analysis of Trump's foreign policy,"" writes David Ignatius in the Washington Post, ""the damage he's done to allies would far outweigh any gains against potential adversaries."" The leading Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, made clear this week that he would confront Trump as someone who has embraced autocrats and neglected allies and the defense of democracy globally. ""No army on Earth can match the electric idea of liberty,"" Biden said this week in his first major foreign policy speech of the campaign at the City University of New York. ""It jumps borders and transcends languages. And can supercharge communities, ordinary citizens and activists. We must once again harness that power and rally the free world."" For Trump to defuse this summer's potential for an escalating transatlantic trade conflict, the first issue up on the agenda is the Airbus-Boeing dispute, and that may set the tone for the overall relationship. At the same time, the U.S. this week announced it had started a section 301 investigation into whether a new French tax on major tech companies was unfair, the same move that preceded punitive tariffs on China. By summer's end, U.S. sanctions could face European companies involved in the North Stream 2 pipeline. Tariffs on European car imports could follow by November. As early as next week, the WTO arbitrator is expected to decide how much of the $11.2 billion of tariffs threatened by the Trump administration on the EU can be applied. The EU has published its own preliminary list of U.S. goods in a $20 billion tit-for-tat plan for retaliatory levies over subsidies to Boeing, though the WTO arbitrator would rule on these several months later. The bottom line is that the WTO has determined that both Boeing and Airbus, the world's two largest plane makers, have received billions in illegal or improper government subsidies to gain advantage in global markets. ""We are both sinners, so with that we are entitled to take action against each other,"" European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said this week in Brussels. ""This would be very unfortunate, of course, because even if we both have sinned, we should put our different sanctions in the freezer and say, 'let's talk.'"" For its part, the United States Trade Representative set the stage by publishing this month a hit list of $4 billion in EU goods to target in retaliation for European aircraft subsidies. The products include cheese, cherries, meat and olives alongside whiskey, helicopters and cast-iron tubes and pipes. USTR will hold a public hearing on the list on August 5. Earlier, the EU published a preliminary list of U.S. goods worth $20 billion in retaliatory tariff targets over subsidies to Boeing. That list includes a food fight of ketchup and nuts as well as bicycle pedals and video game consoles. These tit-for-tat actions would be WTO sanctioned, but it's hard to imagine a better time for a negotiated solution as consumers and smaller companies on both sides of the Atlantic would lose – and only Chinese manufacturers would gain. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier was in Washington this week along with Peter Beyer, Germany's transatlantic coordinator and a member of parliament, trying to head off the aircraft war, the North Stream 2 sanctions and the European car important tariffs. Altmaier said at a German Marshall Fund event that Washington and Brussels could reach a trade deal on industrial products by year's end, were there political will. He said if the two sides could ""streamline and coordinate our respective efforts a little more,"" they could better address China. ""We have to act now,"" he said. Solutions will only be found, however, if both sides recognize the fight isn't one only about aircraft but whether one can shift from confrontation to common cause to better shape the global future.

512,"TOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - China’s growing military might has replaced North Korean belligerence as the main security threat to Japan, Tokyo’s annual defence review indicated on Thursday, despite signs that Pyongyang could have nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. The document’s security assessment on China comes after a section on Japan’s ally, the United States, the first time Beijing has achieved second place in the Defence White Paper and pushing North Korea into third position. Russia, deemed by Japan as its primary threat during the Cold War, was in fourth place. “It is a reflection of the fact that only United States and China can project their influence globally,” a Ministry of Defence official told a news briefing. Japan has raised defence spending by a tenth over the past seven years to counter military advances by Beijing and Pyongyang, including defences against North Korean missiles which may carry nuclear warheads, the paper said. North Korea has conducted a series of short-range missile launches that Tokyo believes show Pyongyang is developing projectiles to evade its Aegis ballistic missile defences. To stay ahead of China’s modernizing military, Japan is buying U.S.-made stealth fighters and other advanced weapons. In its latest budget request, Japan’s military asked for 115.6 billion yen ($1.1 billion) to buy nine Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighters, including six short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variants to operate from converted helicopter carriers. The stealth jets, U.S.-made interceptor missiles and other equipment are part of a proposed 1.2% rise in defence spending to a record 5.32 trillion yen in the year starting April 1. By comparison, Chinese military spending is set to rise this year by 7.5% to about $177 billion from 2018, more than three times that of Japan. Beijing is developing weapons such as stealth fighters and aircraft carriers that are helping it expand the range and scope of military operations. Once largely confined to operating close to the Chinese coast, Beijing now routinely sends its air and sea patrols near Japan’s western Okinawa islands and into the Western Pacific. China has frequently rebuffed concerns about its military spending and intentions, including a ramped up presence in the disputed South China Sea, and says it only desires peaceful development. The Defence White Paper said Chinese patrols in waters and skies near Japanese territory are “a national security concern”. The paper downgraded fellow U.S. ally, South Korea, which recently pulled out of an intelligence sharing pact with Japan amid a spat over their shared wartime history. The move could weaken efforts to contain North Korean threats, analysts said. Other partners, including Australia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and India, feature more prominently in the defence paper. “It’s a reflection of the level of cooperation we undertake with each partner,” the defence ministry official said.

514,"Hudson's Bay Company is selling Lord & Taylor to clothing rental subscription service Le Tote for $100 million. The deal, announced Wednesday, allows the department store chain to continue and potentially transform operations as its sales have fallen and it's lost touch with today's shoppers. It will also allow Hudson's Bay, owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and Hudson's Bay in Canada, to further simplify its business, as Executive Chairman Richard Baker looks to take the company private while the retailer grapples with sweeping industry change. ""We're excited to have reached an agreement with Le Tote that creates a new model for Lord & Taylor, bringing together fashion rental subscriptions with traditional retail,"" said Hudson's Bay CEO Helena Foulkes in a statement. ""...For HBC, this transaction builds upon our previous bold actions, further enabling us to focus on our greatest opportunities, Saks Fifth Avenue and Hudson's Bay."" Baker has already begun to unwind the retail empire he built through deals, selling flash sale site Gilt and European department store Galeria Kaufhof. Hudson's Bay struck a deal with Work Property Advisors and Rhone Capital in 2017 to sell its flagship Lord & Taylor building in New York. It later left the property entirely. Hudson's Bay will be paid $99.5 million Canadian dollars ($75 million) in cash after the deal closes and a secured promissory note of CA$33.2 million ($25 million) is payable in cash after two years. Hudson's Bay will also receive an equity stake in Le Tote, two seats on its board and certain rights as a minority shareholder. Under the deal, Le Tote will acquire Lord & Taylor's brand and intellectual property and assume operations of 38 stores, its digital channels and its inventory. In fiscal 2018, Lord & Taylor generated $1.4 billion, or roughly 14% of Hudson's Bay's $9.4 billion in retail sales. Hudson's Bay has a market value of CA$1.8 billion ($1.35 billion). Le Tote, a rental service founded 2012 that allows subscribers to rent clothes for $79 monthly, has plans to reinvent Lord & Taylor, said its founder, Brett Northart. ""The customers have spoken, and people are looking for smaller, more personalized locations — that's something we do well at Le Tote,"" said Northart. It will look to build out new smaller-format stores, potentially beyond the the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic where Lord & Taylor is traditionally found. It may also repurpose existing Lord & Taylor stores, where locations no longer make sense for the evolving business. As part of the deal, Hudson's Bay will retain ownership of its Lord & Taylor real estate and, starting in 2021, it has the right to reassess and potentially redevelop these locations. For at least the first three years, Hudson's Bay has agreed to be responsible for the rent payments owed by Lord & Taylor, or about C$77 million ($58 million) annually, net of distributions. Le Tote plans to personalize and expand Lord & Taylor's offerings beyond the dresses for which the department store has been historically known. One of those services will be Le Tote's core business: rental. According to a report from data analytics firm GlobalData, the rental subscription market was valued at around $1 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow more than 20% a year, reaching $2.5 billion by 2023. Other retailers like Gap's Banana Republic and Urban Outfitters have recently jumped into the apparel rental market, looking to grab the growth in this segment and reach millennial consumers who have been using these types of services.  Le Tote will look to use data and infrastructure from its rental business to personalize the Lord & Taylor shopping experience, said Northart. ""The [Lord & Taylor] experience is hunt and peck, in a box of 100,000 feet that is tough for a customer,"" he explained.  Lord & Taylor's digital business is currently roughly a quarter of its sales, while a ""best-in-class"" retailer can have as much as 40% of its sales online, said Northart. The company is ""looking at everything"" pertaining to its current strategy, including Lord & Taylor's deal to sell its products through Walmart's website. No decisions on that agreement have yet been made. The moves come as major department stores, including Hudson's Bay, are under pressure as large stores and broad footprints made it harder to adapt to the localized shopping today's consumers now expect. Luxury chain Barneys New York filed for bankruptcy earlier this month and J.C. Penney announced it is working with restructuring advisers to lessen its debt. Shares of Hudson's Bay Company had fallen nearly 50% in the year through June 10, before the Baker-led consortium launched its offer to take the company private. ""We believe that the business plan and value creation initiatives required to address these challenges will be better understood, accepted and executed by patient capital in a private company context,"" Baker and the consortium wrote earlier this month in a push to get the offer approved by shareholders and the special committee appointed to oversee it. The committee has since called the offer ""inadequate,"" while investment firm Catalyst Capital Group has sought to block it. Le Tote is still in the process of securing financing for the deal, the companies said. If it is unable to obtain committed financing within 45 days of signing, Hudson's Bay has the right to terminate the agreement. Hudson's Bay retained PJ Solomon as its financial advisor for review of Lord & Taylor's sale, while Le Tote was advised by Citi."
515,"mÉXICO Las estrictas políticas antiinmigración del presidente Donald Trump hacen que cada vez más migrantes se queden varados en ciudades mexicanas como Ciudad Juárez. CIUDAD JUÁREZ, México — Hace una década los residentes abandonaron el centro de Ciudad Juárez, cuando la recesión y los asesinatos perpetrados por las pandillas de narcotraficantes azotaron esa localidad fronteriza. Pero ahora hay nuevas señales de vida. Miles de cubanos, que esperan la decisión sobre su solicitud de asilo en Estados Unidos, han convertido estas cuadras empobrecidas en su hogar, pues aquí han encontrado trabajo y rentan habitaciones en hoteles baratos. El primer restaurante cubano se inauguró en abril y su personal está conformado por diez empleados migrantes que, entre otras cosas, sirven un platillo tradicional de carne de res deshebrada conocido como ropa vieja, con arroz y frijoles. Afuera, en las aceras, los afiches muestran la bandera cubana, un signo de que los recién llegados están comenzando a forjarse una vida aquí, aunque sea difícil, incierta y temporal. “Todo fue factor suerte”, dijo Ramón Santo Domingo Ramos, el cocinero del restaurante. Las comunidades fronterizas como Ciudad Juárez, llenas de migrantes cubanos, centroamericanos y de otros países, se están adaptando a una nueva realidad: quizá sean el destino final, no solo ya una parada antes de llegar a Estados Unidos. Las estrictas políticas antiinmigración impuestas por el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, han hecho que cada vez más migrantes se queden varados en este tipo de ciudades. La polémica sobre la migración ha resonado mucho en Ciudad Juárez después de que un tirador incitado por el racismo asesinara a veintidós personas el pasado fin de semana en una tienda Walmart en El Paso, Texas, al otro lado de la frontera. “Quieren cruzar a Estados Unidos”, dijo Armando Cabada, el alcalde de Ciudad Juárez. “Tienen su sueño americano. Pero se topan con el muro de Trump”. Desde inicios de este año, el gobierno de Trump ha estado devolviendo a México a algunos migrantes que han solicitado asilo para que esperen allí sus audiencias, mientras sus casos son procesados en los tribunales. En junio, después de que el mandatario amenazara con imponer aranceles a todas las exportaciones mexicanas, el gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador aceptó aumentar el número de migrantes que acogería con la implementación de esa política. Desde entonces, el número de migrantes en Ciudad Juárez ha aumentado a más de 12.000, y se espera que Estados Unidos siga regresando hasta trescientas personas al día en esa región. La ciudad está esforzándose por acomodarlos y trabaja con iglesias católicas y evangélicas para abrir nuevos refugios y colabora con negocios y grupos agrícolas para crear empleos. La semana pasada, el gobierno federal mexicano abrió un refugio en una fábrica vacía para alojar a los solicitantes de asilo que fueron retornados por las autoridades de Estados Unidos. El plan es que los migrantes se queden ahí temporalmente mientras buscan trabajo o se mudan a alguno de los más de diez albergues administrados por iglesias. En una habitación lateral del refugio, más de diez personas (una con un bebé) escuchaban mientras un instructor de informática de una fundación local les explicaba los programas básicos. Soldados servían sopa de pasta, tortillas, pollo y frijoles a unas 160 personas para que almorzaran, mientras que un par de médicos daban consultas. “Estamos lidiando localmente con una situación que nosotros no provocamos”, dijo Enrique Valenzuela, coordinador general del Consejo Estatal de Población del estado de Chihuahua. “Juárez ya es otro”, comentó. “Juárez cambia a partir de todo ese fenomeno”. Desde hace mucho tiempo, Ciudad Juárez ha sido una ciudad de migrantes que se ha extendido hacia el desierto porque muchos mexicanos del resto del país llegaron con la misma esperanza de cruzar a Estados Unidos. Algunos se quedaron por voluntad propia y otros por necesidad, a medida que la frontera se cerraba cada vez más, y encontraron empleos en las fábricas de exportaciones que ahora emplean a más de un cuarto de millón de personas y vinculan a la ciudad con Estados Unidos. Ahora, el camino de los migrantes es más incierto, a pesar del apoyo y los servicios del gobierno local. Hace una década, cuando las bandas de narcotraficantes se disputaban el control de las rutas de contrabando para llegar a Estados Unidos, Ciudad Juárez se convirtió en una de las ciudades más mortíferas del mundo. Aunque la violencia ha disminuido, el crimen organizado todavía está activo y los homicidios están aumentando de nuevo. Tantos migrantes a la deriva son blancos fáciles para el crimen organizado, ya sea como reclutas o como víctimas de secuestro, dijo Josiah Heyman, director del Centro de Estudios Interamericanos y Fronterizos de la Universidad de Texas en El Paso. “Juárez tiene un equilibrio delicado, con el potencial de volver a caer en una gran violencia”, explicó. Rocío Meléndez, una abogada de Derechos Humanos Integrales en Acción, un grupo de defensa de los derechos humanos de Juárez, dijo que el 31 por ciento de las mujeres que le habían referido a lo largo de las últimas tres semanas habían sido víctimas de violación, extorsión, secuestro o trata de personas. “Mucha gente está encerrada en los albergues”, comentó. “Será difícil que se incorporen al mercado laboral”. Incluso cuando lo logran, los bajos salarios no siempre permiten que las familias se muden de los refugios sin ayuda del gobierno. En el refugio El Buen Pastor, las familias languidecen en habitaciones hacinadas con poco en qué ocuparse aparte de sus celulares. “Es una cuestión cultural”, dijo el pastor Juan Fierro García, quien dirige las instalaciones que están expandiendo su cupo de 110 a 250 personas. “Aquí cualquiera que desee trabajar puede encontrar un empleo, incluso sin estatus legal”. Sin embargo, reconoció que las madres se muestran reacias a dejar solos a sus hijos. Muchas de las familias están traumatizadas, pues vienen escapando de la violencia en sus ciudades natales. Dayami, una cubana de 28 años, atravesó la jungla panameña acompañada de su hijo Brandhoon, de 3 años, para llegar a México. “Arriesgas tu propia vida por tus hijos”, dijo Dayami, quien solo proporcionó su nombre porque está en curso su solicitud de asilo en Estados Unidos. El cansancio y la incertidumbre de su caso de asilo le han arrebatado la fuerza mientras espera con su hijo en México, en un albergue dirigido por la iglesia de San Juan Apóstol y Evangelista. Saúl, de 41 años, dijo que le dieron un día para irse de Honduras, posiblemente porque su trabajo como pastor evangélico enfureció a un hombre poderoso de la localidad. Pidió asilo en Estados Unidos junto con su hijo —a quien una pandilla quería reclutar por la fuerza—, su nuera y sus dos hijos pequeños. A su familia le permitieron quedarse y continuar su caso en Estados Unidos. A él lo enviaron de regreso a Ciudad Juárez. Ahora vive en una choza en ruinas al lado de un campo de sorgo y gana algo de dinero cuidando a un poni y a un burro. “A veces me dan ganas de regresarme a Honduras”, dijo Saúl, que solo proporcionó su nombre por motivos similares. En medio de la actual ola migratoria, los cubanos tienen una posición particularmente favorable. Con una mejor educación que los migrantes centroamericanos y generalmente sin niños, de inmediato comienzan a buscar empleo. Los lugareños intercambian anécdotas. Uno de los vigilantes nocturnos es cubano, al igual que la mesera de un lugar muy popular para almorzar. Hace poco llegó un carpintero con dos asistentes cubanos y una peluquera de la isla también empezó a trabajar en un salón de belleza. “Me siento satisfecha y me siento útil”, dijo Náyade Hidalgo Ruiz, de 24 años, quien está trabajando como mesera en el restaurante cubano Little Habana. Ha estado trabajando en Juárez desde que la regresaron de Estados Unidos en junio mientras llega el día de la audiencia por su caso de asilo en diciembre. Graduada como ingeniera química en Cuba, decidió irse cuando la culparon por el colapso de un motor en la empresa de energía eléctrica donde trabajaba. “Alguien tenía que ir preso”, dijo. Como era la empleada más joven, era un chivo expiatorio fácil, comentó. Solo gana poco más de 10 dólares al día. No obstante, incluso ese salario reducido es bienvenido después de su salario de subsistencia y las limitadas opciones alimentarias en Cuba. “Puedo comprar un yogur si quiero”, dijo. “Aquí es distinto. Es capitalismo. Es mejor”. Little Habana es propiedad de Cristina Ibarra, una empresaria de Ciudad Juárez que ha permitido que sus empleados cubanos diseñen los menús y preparen la comida. Un menú completo de platillos cubanos se vende por menos de 3 dólares. Su siguiente plan es abrir una pizzería cubana con Santo Domingo, el cocinero de Little Habana. Él dirigía una pequeña cafetería en Cuba, pero no soportaba las reglas rígidas que el gobierno les impone a los empleos independientes. “La policia se mete mucho con uno”, dijo. “No hay condiciones para hacer negocios”. “Me gusta hacer negocios”, agregó Santo Domingo. A diferencia de Cuba, dijo, “aquí puedo ir al mercado y comprar todo lo que necesito para trabajar”."
516,"* FTSE 100 up 1.3 pct * Miners enjoy stellar gains as metals prices surge * Start of Q1 earnings season lifts sentiment * UK inflation lower than expected * Hammerson drops Intu Properties deal (Updates prices, adds details) By Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Surging mining stocks and a fall in the pound boosted Britain’s FTSE 100 on Wednesday, with metals prices climbing on supply concerns and data showing an unexpected dip in inflation. The index of top UK companies jumped up 1.3 percent to 7,317.34 points, strongly outperforming other European bourses thanks to the weaker pound and its heavy weighting in commodities stocks. Miners were the biggest gainers, driven up by continuing aluminium price strength after U.S. sanctions on Russian producer Rusal sparked concerns of a supply bottleneck in metals markets. Nickel had its biggest one-day gain since the financial crisis, and aluminium prices hit their highest point in nearly seven years. The biggest miners Anglo American, BHP Billiton , Rio Tinto and Glencore all surged by between 5.4 and 7.7 percent. Shares in Russian gold and silver producer Polymetal , which had been hit by worries over the U.S. sanctions, jumped 12 percent after the firm reported a 19 percent jump in first-quarter revenue. Hochschild Mining rose 6.8 percent after its first-quarter production report, and Evraz, Fresnillo and Randgold Resources also made gains. Europe’s index of basic resources stocks enjoyed its best day since November 2016, up 4.3 percent. Strong crude prices also helped drive oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell higher, after sources said Saudi Arabia wants to see crude closer to $100 a barrel. Brent crude futures LCOc1 were up $1.54 at $73.12 by 11:14 EDT (1514 GMT) A weaker sterling also supported the FTSE. The currency fell back after data showed British inflation cooled unexpectedly to a one-year low in March, raising doubts over whether the Bank of England would indeed raise interest rates in May. Sterling’s surge to pre-Brexit vote levels has reduced the forex-related lift enjoyed by foreign currency-earning FTSE 100 companies after sterling’s slump in the aftermath of Britain’s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union. M&A news and results caught investors’ attention. Worries over the UK retail market drove shopping centre operator Hammerson to pull out of its bid to take over smaller rival Intu Properties. Hammerson shares rose 4.2 percent on the news while Intu Properties slid 4.1 percent. “Hammerson pulling out of its £3.5 billion bid for rival Intu Properties is quite a sensible move, particularly since some bigger shareholders were expressing disquiet about the deal,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. He added that risks to the UK retail property sector are becoming more of a concern. Jupiter Fund Management shares fell 4.6 percent after the asset manager suffered 1.3 billion pounds ($1.86 billion) of net outflows in the first quarter. “Jupiter now needs to regain momentum in its net flows before the market recognises any value emerging in its share price,” Jefferies analysts said in a note. Mediclinic shares jumped 9.2 percent, among top FTSE gainers, after the international private healthcare provider said it saw strong revenue growth in its Middle East division. In the small-cap segment, De La Rue, the company that makes British passports, lost 4.4 percent after abandoning its appeal against Britain’s decision to award the contract for the new blue passports to a foreign business. The British government confirmed, after markets closed, that it had awarded the new contract to Dutch firm Gemalto. Crematorium operator Dignity jumped 11.2 percent after reporting first-quarter figures which showed more customers opted for premium funeral packages.

The DCCC is making a big early bet on Texas after Democrats made two gains in House seats in suburban Houston and Dallas. The committee is targeting six GOP representatives in seats that Democrats lost by only a few points in 2018. The committee is also putting targets on two GOP lawmakers under federal indictment, including Reps.

They’ll also be fighting to protect the 31 districts that Trump carried in 2016. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) will be playing offense in those 31 districts as well as looking to protect the three GOP lawmakers in Clinton districts.  Republicans will also be looking to rebound in many of these suburban districts where Trump remains unpopular among many female and college-educated voters.

519," (CNN)The following contains major spoilers about the ""Game of Thrones"" season finale. If ""Game of Thrones"" has been a controlled burn for much of its run, the current season has been a raging fire, exhausting story at a breakneck pace. After a season punctuated by massive battles, the finale wisely capped the penultimate season by steadfastly focusing on the show's characters and dense mythology. It was, from start to finish, a beautifully realized 80 minutes of television, one that reunited a number of key players. The episode then closed with a jaw-dropping visual -- the fall of the giant wall designed to hold back threats from the north, setting up the great war between the living and the army of the dead. There were so many flourishes in the episode crafted to make fans lose their minds it's difficult, frankly, to know where to begin. Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) knows how to make one heck of an entrance by winging in on a dragon, but the producers managed to top that with this season's exit. The highlights included, but certainly weren't limited to, the official unveiling of Jon Snow's true lineage, name and birthright, Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys adding another front to the show's uncomfortably complicated romances; and the Stark sisters, Arya (Maisie Williams) and Sansa (Sophie Turner), teaming up to dispatch the scheming Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen), about as satisfying a farewell as any longtime ""Thrones"" viewer could imagine. Still, this latest installment, directed by Jeremy Podeswa, was equally notable for its small moments, especially the reunions of friend and foe alike. There was the exchange involving the Hound (Rory McCann) and Brienne (Gwendoline Christie), long after their brutal duel; Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) and the mercenary Bronn (Jerome Flynn); and Jon Snow and Theon (Alfie Allen), the two adopted sons of Ned Stark, whose memory, also rekindled in Arya and Sansa's final scene, cast a very long shadow over this chapter. With one more truncated season of six episodes left to resolve the story, it's almost dizzying to contemplate where ""Game of Thrones"" goes from here. With Cersei (Lena Headey, delivering another mesmerizing performance) betraying her pledge to assist in the fight against the White Walkers, that would seem to augur two huge conflicts, as her brother Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) warned, regardless of how the first one turns out. To be fair, not everyone was completely thrilled with the set-up to this week's finale, which yielded plenty of nitpicking about lapses in logic and, among other things, how long it would take a dragon to fly from Point A to B. Still, in racing past George R.R. Martin's books, producers D.B. Weiss and David Benioff have laid the groundwork for a final season that should unleash another media frenzy and require more super-sized episodes, just to squeeze it all in. Having said this before, it nevertheless bears repeating: ""Game of Thrones"" operates at a level unlike anything else on television, coupling the spectacle of a theatrical blockbuster with the sprawling serialized drama of ""The Sopranos."" If the eighth season is on par with the seven episodes of the seventh, when the history of great TV dramas is written, that pairing is going to be a very tough hand to beat. "
520,"YANGON, Myanmar (Reuters) - In April, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg told U.S. senators that the social media site was hiring dozens more Burmese speakers to review hate speech posted in Myanmar. The situation was dire. Some 700,000 members of the Rohingya community had recently fled the country amid a military crackdown and ethnic violence. In March, a United Nations investigator said Facebook was used to incite violence and hatred against the Muslim minority group. The platform, she said, had “turned into a beast.” Four months after Zuckerberg’s pledge to act, here is a sampling of posts from Myanmar that were viewable this month on Facebook: One user posted a restaurant advertisement featuring Rohingya-style food. “We must fight them the way Hitler did the Jews, damn kalars!” the person wrote, using a pejorative for the Rohingya. That post went up in December 2013. Another post showed a news article from an army-controlled publication about attacks on police stations by Rohingya militants. “These non-human kalar dogs, the Bengalis, are killing and destroying our land, our water and our ethnic people,” the user wrote. “We need to destroy their race.” That post went up last September, as the violence against the Rohingya peaked. A third user shared a blog item that pictures a boatload of Rohingya refugees landing in Indonesia. “Pour fuel and set fire so that they can meet Allah faster,” a commenter wrote. The post appeared 11 days after Zuckerberg’s Senate testimony. The remarks are among more than 1,000 examples Reuters found of posts, comments, images and videos attacking the Rohingya or other Myanmar Muslims that were on Facebook as of last week. Almost all are in the main local language, Burmese. The anti-Rohingya and anti-Muslim invective analyzed for this article – which was collected by Reuters and the Human Rights Center at UC Berkeley School of Law – includes material that’s been up on Facebook for as long as six years. The poisonous posts call the Rohingya or other Muslims dogs, maggots and rapists, suggest they be fed to pigs, and urge they be shot or exterminated. The material also includes crudely pornographic anti-Muslim images. The company’s rules specifically prohibit attacking ethnic groups with “violent or dehumanising speech” or comparing them to animals. Facebook also has long had a strict policy against pornographic content. The use of Facebook to spread hate speech against the Rohingya in the Buddhist-majority country has been widely reported by the U.N. and others. Now, a Reuters investigation gives an inside look at why the company has failed to stop the problem. For years, Facebook – which reported net income of $15.9 billion in 2017 – devoted scant resources to combat hate speech in Myanmar, a market it dominates and in which there have been regular outbreaks of ethnic violence. In early 2015, there were only two people at Facebook who could speak Burmese reviewing problematic posts. Before that, most of the people reviewing Burmese content spoke English. To this day, the company continues to rely heavily on users reporting hate speech in part because its systems struggle to interpret Burmese text. Even now, Facebook doesn’t have a single employee in the country of some 50 million people. Instead, it monitors hate speech from abroad. This is mainly done through a secretive operation in Kuala Lumpur that’s outsourced to Accenture, the professional services firm, and codenamed “Project Honey Badger.” According to people familiar with the matter, the project, which handles many Asian countries, hired its first two Burmese speakers, who were based in Manila, just three years ago. As of June, Honey Badger had about 60 people reviewing reports of hate speech and other content posted by Myanmar’s 18 million active Facebook users. Facebook itself in April had three full-time Burmese speakers at a separate monitoring operation at its international headquarters in Dublin, according to a former employee. Honey Badger employees typically sign one-year renewable contracts and agree not to divulge that the client is Facebook. Reuters interviewed more than a half-dozen former monitors who reviewed Southeast Asian content. A Facebook official said outsourcing its content monitoring is more efficient because the companies it uses are specialists in ramping up such operations. He declined to disclose how many Burmese speakers the company has on the job worldwide, saying it was “impossible to know, to be definitive on that.” “It’s not enough,” he added. For many people in this emerging economy, Facebook is the internet: It’s so dominant, it’s the only site they use online. Yet, the company ignored repeated warnings as far back as 2013 that it faced trouble. Researchers and human rights activists say they cautioned Facebook for years that its platform was being used in Myanmar to promote racism and hatred of Muslims, in particular the Rohingya. “They were warned so many times,” said David Madden, a tech entrepreneur who worked in Myanmar. He said he told Facebook officials in 2015 that its platform was being exploited to foment hatred in a talk he gave at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California. About a dozen Facebook people attended the meeting in person, including Mia Garlick, now the company’s director of Asia Pacific policy, he said. Others joined via video. “It couldn’t have been presented to them more clearly, and they didn’t take the necessary steps,” Madden said. In a statement, Garlick told Reuters: “We were too slow to respond to the concerns raised by civil society, academics and other groups in Myanmar. We don’t want Facebook to be used to spread hatred and incite violence. This is true around the world, but it is especially true in Myanmar where our services can be used to amplify hate or exacerbate harm against the Rohingya.” She added that Facebook is focused on addressing challenges that are unique to Myanmar “through a combination of people, technology, policies and programs.” The company also said it has banned several “hate figures and organizations” on Facebook in Myanmar. Facebook’s struggles in Myanmar are among much broader problems it faces. Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony in April primarily focused on the company’s mishandling of user data, whether it censors conservative views and Russia’s exploitation of Facebook to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Of all of Facebook’s travails, though, Myanmar may be the bloodiest. The Myanmar military stands accused by the U.N. of having conducted a brutal campaign of killings, mass rape, arson and ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. The government denies the allegations. The social media giant doesn’t make public its data on hate speech in Myanmar. It says it has 2.2 billion global users and each week receives millions of user reports from around the world about problematic content. In compiling examples of hate speech for this article, Reuters found some that Facebook subsequently removed. But the vast majority remained online as of early August. After Reuters alerted Facebook to some of the derogatory posts included in this story, the company said it removed them. “All of it violated our policies,” it said. Reuters itself sometimes flags to Facebook threats posted on the platform against its reporters. These include the Burmese journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who are on trial in Myanmar on charges of violating a state secrets law. The two were arrested in December while reporting on the massacre of 10 Rohingya men and have received a deluge of death threats on social media over their story. Facebook has removed such content several times at the news agency’s request. Myanmar emerged from decades of military rule in 2011, but religious violence has marred its transition to democracy. In 2012, clashes in Rakhine State between ethnic Rakhine, who are Buddhists, and the Rohingya killed scores of people and left 140,000 displaced – mostly Muslims. Facebook’s extraordinary dominance in Myanmar began taking root around the same time. But not by design. As recently as six years ago, Myanmar was one of the least connected countries on earth. In 2012, only 1.1 percent of the population used the internet and few people had telephones, according to the International Telecommunication Union, a U.N. agency. The junta that had ruled the country for decades kept citizens isolated. That all changed in 2013, when a quasi-civilian government oversaw the deregulation of telecommunications. The state-owned phone company suddenly faced competition from two foreign mobile-phone entrants from Norway and Qatar. The price of SIM cards dropped from more than $200 to as little as $2 and people purchased them in droves. By 2016, nearly half the population had mobile phone subscriptions, according to GSMA Intelligence, the research arm of the industry’s trade association. Most purchased smartphones with internet access. One app went viral: Facebook. Many saw it as an all-in-one solution – offering a messaging system, news, and videos and other entertainment. It also became a status symbol, said Chris Tun, a former Deloitte consultant who advised the government. “If you don’t use Facebook, you’re behind,” he said. “Even grandmas, everyone was on Facebook.” To capture customers, Myanmar’s mobile phone operators began offering a sweet deal: use Facebook without paying any data charges. “Facebook should be sending flowers to me, because we have been an accelerator for bringing the penetration,” said Lars Erik Tellmann, who until July was chief executive of Telenor Myanmar, part of Norway’s Telenor Group. “This was an initiative we took fully on our own. And this was extremely popular.” In Myanmar today, the government itself uses Facebook to make major announcements, including the resignation of the president in March. In the fall of 2013, Aela Callan, an Australian documentary filmmaker studying at Stanford University, began a project on hate speech and false reports that had spread online during conflicts between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims the prior year. In June 2012, at least 80 people had died in riots and thousands of Rohingya were moved into squalid internment camps. Anti-Rohingya diatribes appeared on Facebook. One Buddhist nationalist group set up a page called the “Kalar Beheading Gang.” In November 2013, she met at Facebook’s California headquarters with Elliott Schrage, vice president of communications and public policy. “I was trying to alert him to the problems,” she said. Emails between the two show that Schrage put Callan in touch with internet.org, a Facebook initiative to bring the internet to developing countries, and with two Facebook officials, including one who worked with civil-society organizations to assist the company in coping with hate speech. “He didn’t connect me to anyone inside Facebook who could deal with the actual problem,” she said. Asked for comment, Schrage referred Reuters to a press person at Facebook. The company didn’t comment on the meeting. Matt Schissler, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan, said that between March and December 2014, he held discussions with Facebook officials in a series of calls and online communications. He told them how the platform was being used to spread hate speech and false rumors in Myanmar, he said, including via fake accounts. He and other activists provided the company with specific examples, including a Facebook page in Burmese that was called, “We will genocide all of the Muslims and feed them to the dogs.” The page was removed. Schissler belonged to a private Facebook group that was set up so that Myanmar human rights activists, researchers and company employees such as Asia Pacific policy chief Garlick could discuss how to cope with hate speech and other issues. The activists brought up numerous problems with Facebook’s multi-step reporting system for problematic content. As one example, they cited a photograph of an aid worker in Rakhine State in a post that called him “a traitor to the nation.” It had been shared 229 times, according to messages reviewed by Reuters. One of the private group’s members had reported it to Facebook as harassment of an individual but later received a message back: “We reviewed the photo you reported for containing hate speech or symbols and found it doesn’t violate our Community Standards.” After multiple complaints by activists over six weeks, a Facebook employee finally explained to the activists that the takedown request was rejected because the photo had been reported, but not the comment above it. It eventually was taken down. In March 2015, Schissler gave a talk at Facebook’s California headquarters about new media, particularly Facebook, and anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar. More than a dozen Facebook employees attended, he said. Two months later, Madden, the tech entrepreneur, gave a talk at Facebook headquarters about tensions and violence between Buddhists and Muslims. He said he showed a doctored picture that had spread on Facebook of the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who is Buddhist, wearing a Muslim head scarf. The image, Madden said, was meant to imply she was sympathetic to Muslims – a “very negative message” in Myanmar. “The whole point of this presentation was really just to sound the alarm, to show very vividly the context in which Facebook was operating, and already the evidence of how it was being misused,” he said. He left the meeting thinking his audience took the talk seriously and would take action. Madden had founded a technology hub and start-up accelerator in Yangon called Phandeeyar. He said he and others involved with the venture interacted with Facebook “many dozens” of times over the next several years, including via email, in the private Facebook group and in person, showing how the network’s systems for detecting and removing dangerous content were ineffective. He isn’t sure what steps the company took in response. “The central problem is that the mechanisms that they have to pull down hate speech in a timely way, before it does real world harm, they don’t work,” he said. Madden and Jes Kaliebe Petersen, Phandeeyar’s chief executive, said Facebook was still relying too much on their group and other volunteers to report dangerous posts. “It shouldn’t be incumbent on an organization like ours or people who happen to be well-connected with folks inside Facebook to report these things,” Petersen said. In April, shortly before Zuckerberg’s Senate testimony, Phandeeyar and five other Myanmar groups blasted him for claiming in an interview with Vox that Facebook’s systems had detected and removed incendiary messages in September last year. “We believe your system, in this case, was us,” they wrote. Zuckerberg apologized. Back in 2014, tech organizations and researchers weren’t the only ones sounding alarms with Facebook. So was the Myanmar government. In July of that year, riots broke out in the central city of Mandalay after false rumors spread online, on Facebook and elsewhere, that a Muslim man had raped a Buddhist woman. A Buddhist man and a Muslim man were killed in the fighting. The Myanmar government asked Tun, then a Deloitte consultant, to contact the company. He said he didn’t succeed at first, and the government briefly blocked Facebook. Tun said he eventually helped to arrange meetings between the government and Facebook. “What they promised to do was, when you spot fake news, you could contact them via email,” Tun said of Facebook. “And they would take action – they were willing to take down pages after their own verification process.” The government began reporting cases to Facebook, but Tun said he quickly realized the company couldn’t deal with Burmese text. “Honestly, Facebook had no clue about Burmese content. They were totally unprepared,” he said. “We had to translate it into English for them.” In August 2013, Zuckerberg announced a plan to make the internet available for the first time to billions of people in developing countries. “Everything Facebook has done has been about giving all people around the world the power to connect,” he said. The company would now work, he added, to make “internet access available to those who cannot currently afford it.” But in Myanmar, the language barrier would cause trouble. Most people here don’t speak English. Although Myanmar users at the time could post on Facebook in Burmese, the platform’s interface – including its system for reporting problematic posts – was in English. Making matters worse, the company’s operation for monitoring content in Burmese was meagre. In 2014, the social media behemoth had just one content reviewer who spoke Burmese: a local contractor in Dublin, according to messages sent by Facebook employees in the private Facebook chat group. A second Burmese speaker began working in early 2015, the messages show. In Manila – the original site of the outsourced Project Honey Badger – there were no content reviewers who spoke Burmese. People who reviewed Myanmar content there spoke English. “In cases like hate speech where we didn’t understand the language, we would say, ‘I don’t know the language,’” said a person who worked there. “So the client had to solve that,” the person said, referring to Facebook. By 2015, Facebook had around four Burmese speakers reviewing Myanmar content in Manila and Dublin. They were stretched thin: that year Facebook had 7.3 million active users in Myanmar. Accenture slowly began to hire more Burmese speakers. With the help of volunteer translators, Facebook also introduced a Burmese-language interface. By 2016, the Honey Badger project had moved to Kuala Lumpur after Accenture convinced Facebook it would be easier to recruit Burmese and others to work in Malaysia’s capital than in further-off Manila, according to a person familiar with the matter. In an office tower in Kuala Lumpur, teams of content monitors are assigned to handle different Asian countries, not just Myanmar. They are paid around $850 to $1000 a month and are often employed by temporary staffing agencies, according to ex-employees and online recruitment ads. Facebook said in a statement: “We’ve chosen to work only with highly reputable, global partners that take care of their employees, pay them well and provide robust benefits - this includes Accenture in Asia Pacific.” A spokesperson for Accenture confirmed it partners with Facebook. “The characterization of our operations as ‘secretive’ is misleading and confidentiality is in place primarily to protect the privacy and security of our people and the clients we serve,” the spokesperson said. Former content monitors said they often each had to make judgments on 1,000 or more potentially problematic content items a day, although the number is now understood to be less. Facebook’s complete rules about what is and isn’t allowed on its platform are spelled out in its internal community standards enforcement guidelines, which the company made public for the first time in April. It defines hate speech as “violent or dehumanising speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion or segregation” against people based on their race, ethnicity, religious affiliation and other characteristics. In response, Facebook said: “Content reviewers aren’t required to evaluate any set number of posts ... We encourage reviewers to take the time they need.” A Facebook official also told Reuters the community standards policy is global, “but there are local nuances,” such as slurs, that content reviewers who are native speakers can consider when making decisions. But former content monitors told Reuters the rules were inconsistent; sometimes they could make exceptions and sometimes they couldn’t. Former content monitors also said they were trained to err on the side of keeping content on Facebook. “Most of the time, you try to give the user the benefit of the doubt,” said one former Facebook employee. The ex-monitors said they sometimes had as little as a few seconds to decide if a post constituted hate speech or violated Facebook’s community standards in some other way. They said they didn’t actually search for hate speech themselves; instead, they reviewed a giant queue of posts mostly reported by Facebook users. Many of the millions of items flagged globally each week – including violent diatribes and lurid sexual imagery – are detected by automated systems, Facebook says. But a company official acknowledged to Reuters that its systems have difficulty interpreting Burmese script because of the way the fonts are often rendered on computer screens, making it difficult to identify racial slurs and other hate speech. Facebook’s troubles are evident in a new feature that allows users to translate Burmese content into English. Consider a post Reuters found from August of last year. In Burmese, the post says: “Kill all the kalars that you see in Myanmar; none of them should be left alive.” Facebook’s translation into English: “I shouldn’t have a rainbow in Myanmar.” In response, Facebook said: “Our translations team is actively working on new ways to ensure that translations are accurate.” The company said it uses a different system to detect hate speech. Guy Rosen, vice president of product management, wrote in a blog post on Facebook in May about the problems the company faced in identifying hate speech. “Our technology still doesn’t work that well and so it needs to be checked by our review teams,” he wrote. Facebook officials say they have no immediate plans to hire any employees in Myanmar itself. But the company does contract with local agencies for tasks unrelated to content monitoring. One is Echo Myanmar, a communications firm whose managing director is Anthony Larmon, an American. Larmon has expressed strong opinions on the Rohingya. Toward the end of 2016, the Myanmar army launched an onslaught across some 10 villages after Rohingya militants attacked border posts. At the time, a U.N. official accused the government of seeking “ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya. In November 2016, Larmon wrote that an article about the U.N. allegation was “misleading.” He cited what he said were claims by multiple “local journalists” that the ethnic minority “purposely exaggerate (lie about)” their situation to “get more foreign aid and attention.” He also wrote: “No, they aren’t facing ethnic cleansing or anything remotely close to what that incendiary term suggests.” He said he later removed the post. A Facebook spokesperson said that Larmon’s post “does not represent Facebook’s view.” Larmon told Reuters: “It was overly-emotional, under-informed commentary on a highly nuanced subject that I do regret. My view on the Rohingya, same today as then, is that they should be safely repatriated and protected.” The platform on which he aired his views about the Rohingya? Facebook.

522,"You can pretend to be anyone on the internet. Even the mayor of a small town.  A security researcher did just that and acquired an official .gov domain name, which could have been used to spread fake emergency alerts or ask Facebook for private user information.  The researcher successfully registered the domain name exeterri.gov after posing as the mayor of the Exeter, Rhode Island — a small town with a population of less than 6,500 people. According to the individual, who reached out to cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs of Krebs on Security, all they had to do was set up a fake Google Voice number and Gmail address, both completely unaffiliated with the town. After that, they filled out an official authorization form, which basically asks for the same contact information a registrar like GoDaddy or Namecheap would require.  The documents needed to be printed on the town government’s official letterhead, which the researcher obtained by searching for other official Exeter documents online.  According to a town clerk from Exeter, the only inquiry the city received from the GSA came 10 days after the researcher’s fake registration was approved. And the GSA only called Exeter after Krebs on Security asked about the domain. While the exeterri.gov domain has since been revoked, this case exposes serious flaws in the system that could be used for nefarious purposes.  For example, the researcher was able to sign up for Facebook’s law enforcement subpoena request system, which provides law enforcement and government entities with personal user records. “GSA is working with the appropriate authorities and has already implemented additional fraud prevention controls,” said the agency in a statement to Krebs on Security.  Before it was taken down, the researcher's .gov domain displayed the same content as the official Exeter website. It’s not hard to imagine someone using the fake site to spread fear through terror alerts, or ruin reputations with false arrest records, or post inaccurate voting information to sway an election. Sure, that be considered wire fraud or criminal impersonation. But some people — say, foreign entities — might be willing to risk prosecution.  Initially, .gov domain names were only open to federal U.S. institutions. Now they're open to state and local governments. Last month, a bill was introduced in Congress to improve oversight over government domains by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. "
523,"ONE need only drive 30km west from the bustling heart of downtown Nanjing—population about 7m—to reach the shady sanctuary of the Laoshan National Forest Park (pictured). But on a recent sparkling autumn afternoon only a trickle of visitors had come to enjoy the abundant birdsong, the scent of pines and the rustle of falling ginkgo leaves. Unlike many of China’s wilderness attractions, Laoshan has eschewed the hurly-burly of market stalls and other facilities intended to cater to a crush of tourists. There are simple wooden steps installed here and there, but no concrete staircases, iron railings or trails festooned with coloured pennants and loudspeakers playing soppy music. Roughly 18% of China is given over to national parks or protected areas of some sort. But there is no overarching system for managing or even designating such places; instead, they are subject to a complicated, overlapping and haphazard mix of local, provincial and national administration. Laoshan is a case in point. Since its establishment in 1991, its official status has changed multiple times, from a provincial scientific reserve to an environmental one to an “AAA-level touristic scenic spot”. Its current “national park” designation only appears on some signs. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Happily, through all these incarnations, Laoshan has escaped the urge of many bureaucrats to manage scenic spots more for profit than for conservation. Provincial authorities often take it upon themselves to name places as national parks, with a view to selling overpriced tickets or fostering pell-mell development. Environmental protection, if considered at all, is typically an afterthought. Partly because of this uneven quality, a handful of sites attract the lion’s share of visitors. China’s increasingly urbanised and urbane population has a growing appreciation of the great outdoors. Nature-lovers are choosing to stop and smell the roses at national parks, rather than simply snapping a few photos. That means more overnight camping and hiking, rather than a brief shuffle past on a half-day bus tour. Yet there is no logic or consistency to the facilities on offer, the fees charged, the development permitted or the conservation work undertaken at China’s 8,000-odd parks, reserves and protected areas. They are run not just by different levels of government, but by different agencies at each level: some fall under the forestry administration, some under the ministry of environmental protection and others under the tourism-promotion agency. The authorities are trying to instil some order to this jumble—and in the process taking advice from an unlikely source: America’s National Park Service (NPS). For many Chinese visitors to America, the tourist itinerary has recently begun to include not only Disney World, Las Vegas and New York, but also national parks such as Yellowstone. In 2015 1.1m Chinese visited national parks and monuments in America, more than twice as many as three years earlier. Last year the national government began consulting the NPS and several NGOs with a view to creating a park system similar to America’s. Bureaucratic turf wars are the biggest obstacle to reform. In some cases, one agency is responsible for the trees, another for the rivers and lakes, a third for the wildlife and a fourth for the roads leading to it all. The natural bureaucratic reluctance to cede power is all the greater where profits from tourism fees or concessions are at stake. A provincial forestry official in south-western Yunnan province—the site of many protected areas—privately predicts that infighting will persist and that progress towards a more orderly system will be slow. Yet the rewards could be great. A more coherent system could not only improve conservation, but also raise revenue, by helping to promote less-visited sites. America’s national parks received some 307m visits last year; tourists spent almost $17bn in their vicinity. Rudy D’Alessandro of the NPS says Chinese officials have told him: “We don’t want you giving us your culture because we don’t always like your culture. But we admire your national parks and want to learn more about them.”"
524,"President Donald Trump on Friday insisted that his administration is still actively considering a plan to release detained immigrants into so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" a strategy which was rejected twice in the past year by the Department of Homeland Security. The announcement, which came via Twitter, and which the president later doubled-down on, followed an initial report late Thursday about the plan by The Washington Post. ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,"" the president wrote in a post on Twitter. ""....The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!"" the president wrote in a second tweet. Trump's announcement is a near-total reversal by the president of the official position his White House has taken so far. In a statement Thursday to reporters, a Homeland Security Department spokesman said the plan ""was a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion."" A former DHS official, discussing the White House's thinking, told NBC News that the plan was dropped when it was deemed ""so illegal."" In a statement following the president's tweet, a White House spokesperson chided Democrats for opposing the plan and said they ""should be working with the Administration."" ""Democrats say we must have open borders and that illegal immigrants have a right to be in this country at all costs, so they should be working with the Administration to find the best ways to transport those illegal aliens that are already set for release, into communities in their states and districts,"" the spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said. Later Friday, during an event related to 5G deployment, the president said that ""we will bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it, whether it's a state, or whatever that might be."" ""We can give them an unlimited supply, and let's see if they're so happy,"" Trump said. According to The Washington Post, the plan was geared toward delivering political retribution to Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose San Francisco district was discussed as a target. Pelosi on Friday told reporters that the plan was ""just another notion that is unworthy of the presidency of the United States and disrespectful, the challenges we face as a country, as a people to address who we are — a nation of immigrants."" Trump's decision to revive the proposal reflects a growing sense of desperation within the administration over the rising number of migrant families arriving at the southern border to seek asylum. Several of Trump's attempts to detain and deter the asylum seekers have been struck down by courts in recent weeks. Most recently, a federal judge last week ruled that the Trump administration cannot force asylum seekers to remain on the Mexican side of the border while awaiting an asylum hearing in the United States. This stark reversal of policy reflects the dearth of ideas within the White House as to how to confront the migration crisis on both a policy level and a political one. The court decisions, coupled with the failure early this year of Trump's plan to use a government shutdown to force congressional Democrats to fund his promised border wall, have left the White House with few remaining options to contain the ever-increasing flow of families seeking asylum. That difficulty could pose a challenge for the president's reelection bid. As Trump embarks on what is expected to be a tough reelection battle over the coming year, controlling undocumented immigration is a promise that remains at the center of his campaign."

Biden has defended his conduct but not apologized, saying he did nothing intentionally wrong.

526,"Trilobites For the first time that we know, an interstellar visitor has zoomed through our solar system. The small space rock, tentatively called A/2017 U1, is about a quarter of a mile long and astronomers across the world are racing to study it before it departs just as quickly as it arrived. “We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Rob Weryk, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy. On Oct. 19, Dr. Weryk was reviewing images captured by the university’s Pan-STARRS 1 telescope on the island of Maui when he came across the object. At first he thought it was a type of space rock known as a near earth object, but he realized its motion did not make sense. It was much faster than any asteroid or comet he had seen before. He quickly realized that it was not of this solar system. “It’s moving so fast that the Sun can’t capture it into an orbit,” Dr. Weryk said. After contacting a colleague at the European Space Agency to discuss the find, he submitted it to the Minor Planet Center, which tracks objects in the solar system, to share with other astronomers. “I was not expecting to see anything like this during my career, even though we knew it was possible and that these objects exist,” said Davide Farnocchia, a navigational engineer with NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Astronomers had predicted such an occurrence, but this is the first time that it has been recorded. For the past few days Dr. Farnocchia has been calculating the strange object’s path. “It was obvious that the object has a hyperbolic orbit,” he said, meaning that its trajectory is open-ended rather than elliptical like the objects in our solar system. That shows that it came from outside the solar system and will leave the solar system. The object came closest to the Sun on Sept. 9, at a distance of about 23 million miles. With a boost from the star’s gravity, it zoomed by at about 55 miles per second with respect to the Sun, Dr. Farnocchia said. Then on Oct. 14 the object came within about 15 million miles of Earth, zipping by at about 37 miles per second, with respect to the Earth. That’s more than three times as much velocity as the escape trajectory for the New Horizons spacecraft, which completed a flyby of Pluto in 2015, he said. Now it’s moving away at about 25 miles per second, he said, and will exit the solar system at about 16 miles per second. That is faster than the current velocity of the Voyager 1 spacecraft, which became the first spacecraft from Earth to enter interstellar space in August 2012. Scientists around the world are watching its journey, hoping to glean as much information as they can before it gets too far away. “We are just scrambling right now to secure big telescope time, prepare our observations and download the data,” said Karen Meech, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy. Because the object came from outside our solar system, it may be made up of completely different material than the asteroids and comets that we have studied. She and other astronomers think that in the next few weeks they will have more insight into the composition and size of A/2017 U1, and in time, where exactly it came from. Dr. Meech noted that scientists did not have much warning about this object when it came into the solar system because it was blocked by the brightness of the sun. It very much came without warning, she said. But there is no need to panic, said Lindley Johnson, NASA’s planetary defense officer. In the realm of things that could hit Earth and obliterate our existences, an interstellar Armageddon is pretty low on the list. “The near-earth asteroids are many times, hundreds of thousands of times, more likely to occur, and even those are extremely rare events,” Mr. Johnson said. “It’s really nothing that people should worry about. I certainly don’t lie awake worrying about it.”"

529,"Helen Dunmore, a British poet and historical novelist whose widely praised books were known for their gothic plots about loss and legacy, died on June 5 in Bristol, England. She was 64. Her son, Patrick, said the cause was cancer. It was no coincidence that Ms. Dunmore’s last novel, “Birdcage Walk,” concerns what writers leave behind. She knew well before it was finished that she was dying. With that book, her own abundant legacy includes 15 novels, 12 collections of poetry, 3 books of short stories, 16 magical books for children and 8 for young adults. Her final book, a poetry collection titled “Inside the Wave,” was published in April. Her last poem was written on May 25, and her publisher, Bloodaxe, released it the day after she died. It will be included in the second edition of that final anthology. Ms. Dunmore’s first collection of poetry, “The Apple Fall” (1983), was published when she was 30, but it was her celebration of nature in “The Raw Garden” (1988) that established her reputation. After flirting with autobiographical novels (which were never printed), she published her first novel, “Zennor in Darkness” (1993), when she was 40. Her personification of history in the book, and the impact of warfare and loss on people’s lives — in this case, those of D. H. Lawrence and his German wife, the former Frieda von Richthofen, who were suspected of being spies in Cornwall after World War I — became a template for her future fiction. “Zennor in Darkness” (the title refers to a village in Cornwall) won the 1994 McKitterick Prize for debut novelists. “I wanted to write about people who had not left behind their own accounts of their lives,” Ms. Dunmore wrote in The Guardian in March. “Their letters have been lost, their pamphlets have not been preserved, their money has not amounted to an inheritance and they had no epitaphs. Historical record does not know them, but fiction can imagine them.” In 1996, her “A Spell of Winter,” about siblings growing up on their grandfather’s estate, won the inaugural Orange Prize for Fiction (now the Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction). Her first novel to be published in the United States, in 1997, was “Talking to the Dead,” a tale of two adult sisters, and of loss and abandonment, that appeared in Britain a year earlier. It drew praise from Carol Kino in The New York Times Book Review. “What makes Ms. Dunmore’s story so gripping and complex,” she wrote, “is her ability to convey many different layers of experience at once.” Ms. Dunmore’s novel “The Siege” (2001), about fallibility and fortitude during the harrowing Nazi blockade of Leningrad during World War II, was shortlisted for the Orange and Whitbread prizes. Her novel “The Betrayal” (2010) about postwar Russia, was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. And her poem “The Malarkey,” which she said was about “what time takes away and how we take time for granted,” won the 2010 National Poetry Competition in Britain after she had submitted it anonymously. “Leningrad and Cornwall’s Zennor came alive under her forensic eye and delicate touch,” her friend Prof. Helen Taylor, of the University of Exeter, wrote this week on the website Bristol247.com. “Ghosts as traces of unrecorded lives haunt her writing, and her keen feminist and liberal conscience imbue her work with moral power and gravitas.” Ms. Dunmore typically took two years to write a novel, she told The Telegraph in 2003. “Technically, I think, the hardest thing about writing a novel is the organization and pacing,” she said. “You cannot have it going at one pitch all the way through. It’s like a musical composition. There must be pauses, rest periods, accelerations, crescendos.” She added, “In a way, character drives plot, because there are some things that a character cannot do, that it would be impossible for them to do, and you realize that when you get to know the character better.” She wrote in The Guardian: “The key thing about fiction, as in life, is that no character knows what is going to happen. Every one is locked into the present moment, as we are now.” Every character also has to eat, and Ms. Dunmore transformed mastication into a suggestive poetic metaphor. “To write of food with love is the most innocent of pornographies,” she once wrote in a passage quoted by The Telegraph. “Say that Bernard has got up early and gone to market. He comes back with a basket of woven straw, in which nestle four fat, perfectly ripe figs. He gives the basket to Julia. Figs for breakfast. “Their skin is as soft as suede,” she continued. “Julia chooses a fig and breathes in its spicy, sun-warmed fragrance. Bernard produces a bowl of thick yellow cream. Julia dips her fig into the cream, raises it to her mouth, and bites. The luscious, warm, grainy flesh melts into the cool unctuousness of cream. Years later, Bernard and Julia will never be able to separate the taste of figs from that of one another’s lips.” Ms. Dunmore was born on Dec. 12, 1952, in Beverley, in East Yorkshire, to Maurice Dunmore, who managed industrial companies and was a poetry aficionado, and to the former Betty Smith. Ms. Dunmore often recalled that her childhood ambition was to become a poet. She graduated from the University of York with a degree in English in 1973 and taught English in Finland before moving to Bristol, where she taught literature and creative writing. Her husband, Francis Charnley, a lawyer, survives her. In addition to her son, Patrick, she is also survived by their daughter, Tess; a stepson, Ollie; and three grandchildren. Her last book, “Birdcage Walk,” published by Hutchinson, takes place in another time, around the French Revolution, but in a real place. (Birdcage Walk is a path leading through an overgrown church graveyard in Clifton, a suburb of Bristol in England’s southwest.) She also wrote it under a real shadow, her cancer diagnosis. As she did, she thought about the broad meaning of legacy, from a family story retold through generations to the influence of a specific person who, “while nameless, soaked into the fabric of their times and changed the color.” “There is a tendency to think and talk as if it is not the mark we leave upon time that we need to think about but the endless years that will be ours if we eat well enough and exercise effectively enough to dodge the grave,” Ms. Dunmore wrote in The Guardian. Those thoughts permeated her book. “I think of what is the mark that any human being leaves behind, which when you are very ill you’re bound to think about,” she told BBC Radio 4. “‘What is the purpose of my existence? Have I fulfilled my existence?’ and the characters are asking that question of themselves.” Confronting death directly in her final poem, she compared it to a mother’s tender embrace. It was called “Hold Out Your Arms” and began: “Death, hold out your arms for me Embrace / me Give me your motherly caress” It ended this way: As you push back my hair— Which could do with a combBut never mind — You murmur‘We’re nearly there.’"
530,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Rand Paul on Tuesday threatened to vote ‘no’ on a budget resolution Republican leaders aim to bring up for a vote this week unless they decide to stick with spending caps, potentially putting the party’s tax cut plans at risk. “I have told the White House and (Republican) leaders that if they simply stick to their own caps, the rest of the budget is fine and I’ll vote yes,” Paul wrote on Twitter. “It is a simple, but important, change they could easily make. The ball is in their court.” Republican leaders can afford to lose only two Republican votes on the budget plan, which would pave the way for large-scale tax cuts, if Democrats remain united in opposition. With Senator Thad Cochran out of town for health reasons, a defection by Paul would leave the vote on a razor’s edge. Reporting by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Doina Chiacu"
531,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, June 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Chongqing Nan'an Urban Construction & Development (Group) Co., Ltd.'s (CQNA) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings at 'BBB+'. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the 'BBB+' long-term foreign-currency ratings on the following notes issued by CQNA: - USD300 million 2.875% senior unsecured note due 2019 - USD500 million 3.625% senior unsecured note due 2021 - USD200 million 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2026 KEY RATING DRIVERS Linked to Chongqing Municipality: CQNA's ratings are credit-linked to Fitch's internal assessment of the creditworthiness of Chongqing Municipality. The link reflects strong oversight and supervision by the government, mid-range integration with the municipal budget, together with mid-range strategic importance of CQMA's public-sector business to the municipality. These factors indicate the likelihood that CQNA would receive extraordinary support, if needed. CQNA is classified as a credit-linked public-sector entity under Fitch's criteria. Chongqing's Creditworthiness: Chongqing is one of four central-government-controlled municipalities in China and serves as one of the key growth drivers of China's western development. The municipality's gross regional product growth rate was China's fastest in 2016. The strengths are partially offset by its high level of contingent liabilities arising from the state-owned enterprises operating in the municipality, as well as its relatively weak transparency. Strategic Importance Attribute at Mid-range: CQNA is one of the most important urban developers in Chongqing. The company executes the government's urbanisation plan for the Chongqing Nan'an district. Its business focuses on urban infrastructure and primary land development. CQNA also acts as a funding centre for state-owned enterprises within the district. Government Integration Attribute at Mid-Range: Fitch believes support, if required, will ultimately come from the Chongqing municipal government due to the district government's strong fiscal and operational linkage with the Chongqing municipal government, which has provided capital injections and subsidies to monetarily support CQNA's business. Mid-range Legal Status: CQNA is registered as a local state-owned limited liability company under Chinese company law and is under the direct supervision of Chongqing Nan'an State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Tight Control and Supervision: The government closely monitors CQNA's financing plan and debt levels. The company regularly reports its budget performance and its board members, except for employee representatives, are appointed by the government. The Control attribute is assessed at Stronger. Weak Standalone Profile: CQNA's standalone credit profile is constrained by the public-service nature of its business of building affordable housing and developing infrastructure projects. The company has some businesses operated on a partly commercial basis, which help make up for losses incurred by its public-service projects. However, these businesses are still far from market-based. The weak standalone credit profile is mitigated by its strategic links with the government. RATING SENSITIVITIES A stronger or more explicit commitment of support from the municipal government may trigger positive rating action on CQNA. Significant changes to CQNA's strategic importance, dilution of the government's shareholding or reduced implicit government support could lead to a wider rating gap between CQNA and its sponsor. An upgrade of Fitch's credit view on Chongqing Municipality may trigger positive rating action on CQNA. Negative rating action on CQNA could derive from a deterioration of the credit profile of Chongqing Municipality, which could lower Fitch's internal assessment of the municipality's creditworthiness. A rating action on CQNA would also lead to similar action on the ratings on the US dollar notes.

532,"Washington (CNN)Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign official, said she was placating Omarosa Manigault Newman when she indicated on tape that she believed President Donald Trump had been recorded saying the n-word. ""Your viewers, I'm pretty sure, have run into an individual that is the complete epitome of annoying to where you absolutely have to finally give in in order to get on about your day,"" Pierson said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront.""  ""That happened a number of times because Omarosa is a bully."" Manigault Newman provided CBS News with audio from the 2016 campaign. In the audio played on CBS earlier Tuesday, Manigault Newman, Pierson and campaign aide Lynne Patton discussed the possible existence of a recording where Trump said the n-word, and Pierson can be heard saying, ""No, he said it. He is embarrassed by it."" Pierson told CNN on Tuesday evening that Manigault Newman had brought up the possibility of the Trump n-word tape frequently, like ""a dog with a bone,"" and that she placated Manigault Newman ""a number of times because she would not let this tape go."" Patton made a similar point in a separate interview on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360.""  ""There were a lot of times that we talked about this tape because Omarosa was literally obsessed with it,"" Patton said. ""She brought it up constantly. It's clear now that the reason why she did was because she was surreptitiously recording us."" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said earlier Tuesday that she could not guarantee the tape did not exist, and the interview Tuesday evening added to a winding and ongoing story about the alleged n-word recording, which Trump has denied. Pierson said for her part, she had never heard Trump say the n-word, and confirmed to CNN that she signed a non-disclosure agreement. ""I did sign an NDA with the campaign because everyone signed an NDA with the campaign,"" Pierson said. ""I wouldn't come on this program as a black woman, Erin, and tell you that someone didn't say a derogatory term when they did. I would just leave the campaign. It's that simple."" "
533," (CNN)Iowa and Nevada voters won't be bound by one date and time to participate in the 2020 Democratic caucuses, marking one of the most significant changes to the decades-old tradition. The states represent half of the first four contests in the Democratic primary process, which create critical launching pads for winners to become the party's presidential nominee.   After the Democratic National Committee passed new rules in August requiring states to expand voting opportunities, the states changed the process to allow for virtual caucusing. This gives voters who work late, have disabilities or simply can't make the in-person contest a chance to partake in the process. What is virtual caucusing and how does it work? The virtual caucus is meant to simulate the same experience voters have at the in-person precincts. During a typical in-person caucus, voters choose their first preference for president. If one or more of those candidates don't receive at least 15% of that initial vote, they are removed from contention. Any voter backing those candidates can ""realign"" to pick their second preference. This continues until all candidates receive the minimum 15% viability threshold of support Both states will give these voters a chance to rank their preferences, so they can realign them if their candidate of choice doesn't reach the threshold. Iowa currently plans to give voters up to five choices. Nevada hasn't determined its maximum amount of choices yet. Iowa will hold six virtual caucuses by phone, one every day from January 29 through February 3, 2020, during which voters will hear an introduction from a chair and a possible ""final pitch"" from the campaigns before voting. The pitch could also be published in letters or videos on a website beforehand. ""We looked at a lot of different [technology] options,"" Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price told CNN. ""As we looked at it, we wanted to have the type of technology that was as inclusive as possible. There are some people who may not have access or aren't proficient at using a computer.  We figured [phones are] the most inclusive technology that we could use."" Nevada will go further, offering virtual and in-person early voting. Virtual caucusing will take place over two days by phone; other details are still being worked out. The state party will also have early voting at precinct sites around the state, as well as Caucus Day voting locations on the Las Vegas strip, targeted at workers in the hospitality industry who might not be able to make it to their precinct to vote.  ""The big priority is ensuring this is an easy and short process,"" Nevada Democratic Party Caucus Director Shelby Wiltz told CNN. ""In person takes time -- this will obviously be a much shorter option for folks who don't have a lot of time on their hands."" Participants voting virtually will have multiple opportunities to confirm and change their votes during the call and at the end before they are submitted.  How will the votes be counted?  Counting the votes won't be easy, nor the same in the states. Iowa is creating ""virtual counties"" in each of its four congressional districts. After the final virtual caucuses conclude, voters that participated will be split up by into their district, as determined by their addresses, and counted as part of that overall number.  Price said allocating each participant by precincts in the state's 99 counties would be confusing for both voters and precinct captains. Nevada is counting all virtual and early voting within each voters' precinct. They plan to have the results combined at the precinct site during the in-person contest. ""We feel it's really important that no matter how you choose, your vote is counted equally,"" Nevada Democratic Party Communications Director Molly Forgey told CNN. ""We will be tabulating everyone's vote at the precinct level, so if you participate early or virtually, you will be redirected to your precinct and counted with your neighbors."" How are they preparing for this?  The state parties know all eyes will be on their states next February. Iowa and Nevada were both bitterly contested by the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaigns last cycle. The close results fueled fights between the campaigns during the proceeding conventions that eventually picked the delegates to the national convention. To head some of that off, the parties are educating anyone and everyone who will listen. Both states will create teams and websites with multiple training tools on them. The early focus on precinct organizers, campaigns and voters are critical to ensuring the contests are run smoothly. ""We are going to be starting training here in the next couple of weeks,"" Price said. ""We did a round of training campaigns that just concluded over the month of May. We sat down with all the campaigns that have a presence on the ground. The campaigns play a big role."" How are they dealing with security? Looming over all of this is security. The DNC, state parties, and voters in the states are hyper-focused on security, including verifying voters, technology, and ensuring no vote tampering. ""Security is our number one priority,"" Wiltz said. ""It's something we think about all the time and something we think about in every step of this process."" Final voter verification details are still being worked out in the states. Two-factor authentication will be required for voters in Iowa with some form of personal identification like the last four digits of a social security number or driver's license number. Nevadans will receive a unique login and credential after registering to vote virtually. The parties will also be testing their systems with outside groups and the DNC before February to ensure their systems are secure. The future is now? Is this the beginning for virtual voting? It's too soon to say whether this is a model for the future. Campaigns, voters, state parties and the DNC will hone in on the process and weigh in in the months before and after on how well it goes.  ""We recognize the importance that has on conversations going forward,"" Price said. ""I think if it goes well, we'll learn a lot from this process. I think if it goes well, it will be something people use going forward to increase participation and increase access to voting."" "

537,"Washington (CNN)Two Republican members of Congress who were leaving Wednesday's morning baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, said they believe they were approached by the alleged shooter moments before he opened fire on their colleagues. Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis told CNN that a middle-aged man in his late 50s to 60s approached him and Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina as they were leaving practice to ask whether those playing on the field were Republicans or Democrats. When Duncan responded that they were Republicans playing, the man turned around and left.  DeSantis said he didn't realize the connection until later, when heard the news of the shooting, and alerted the police. ""We reported this individual. Since he's been identified, the picture on the individual's Twitter page matches the individual,"" said DeSantis. ""I'm very sure. It's the type of thing where I've seen him for 10 seconds, and for seeing him for 10 seconds I'm as sure as I can be."" DeSantis said the man seemed ""a little weird"" and when he was told Republicans were those playing on the field, the man reacted with ""a little bias, but not enough that I thought he was going to go commit acts of violence."" Federal law enforcement sources have identified to CNN the suspected shooter as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois. The suspect was killed after exchanging shots with police at the scene. DeSantis was in the backseat of the car at the time and said he was only able to see the man from the chest up. Remarking about the man's appearance, DeSantis said he was ""the type of guy if you were walking down the street you wouldn't pick him out or think anything of him."" Duncan was in the passenger seat and got a clearer view of who he believes to be the shooter.  ""After I heard about the shooting, (Alexandria police) asked me to come down there because I did have an interaction with someone in the parking lot who asked me if the team practicing was a Democrat or a Republican team. I told him they were Republicans. He said 'K, thanks,' and turned around."" Duncan said the man was wearing a red shirt but he didn't see anything in his hands. He added that he didn't see any partisan logos on his body or clothing. When asked if he thought his teammates were targeted because they were Republican, Duncan said yes. ""Based on the question he asked me, I would make that assumption because he asked me if this team was the Republican or Democrat team practicing. I responded that it was a Republican team practicing and he proceeded to shoot Republicans. Take that for what it's worth,"" he said. CNN's Pete Grieve contributed to this report."

542,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell more than 1 percent late on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China.   S&P 500 e-mini futures EScv1 were down 1.4 percent in trading for the overnight session. Dow futures 1YMcv1 were down 1.7 percent.  Trump, in a statement, said he proposed the additional tariffs “in light of China’s unfair retaliation” against earlier U.S. actions that included $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods.  “These potential trade wars are not good for the market,” said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. “I don’t think the market will perceive them as good for the economy, so therefore they’re not good for the market. It doesn’t surprise me that as the rhetoric heats up, the market is weak.”  Hedge fund manager Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management Inc, said he was shorting the Standard & Poor’s 500.”The hastily crafted policy like we have seen from Trump over the last two, three days and now tonight in a world that is flat and ever-more interconnected is dangerous.”  The probabilities of a recession in the last half of 2019 and early 2020 are increasing in odds and maybe quite dramatically, Kass added, saying: “The bottom line is that our president is going to make market volatility and economic uncertainty great again.”   During the regular session, the Dow .DJI and the S&P 500 .SPX posted gains for a third day in a row, the longest streak in about a month, as investors' worries of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China began to ease.  On Wednesday, Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was involved in a “negotiation” with China rather than a trade war.  Bob Smith, president and chief investment officer at Sage Advisory Services Ltd Co in Austin, Texas, said the markets were going to react adversely to Trump’s latest statement.  “Anything that’s twice as large as the last number is going to elicit a response, and I think that we’re just going to be going on this hayride for a while until they get themselves around the table and start talking turkey ... at some point the market’s going to get fed up with it.”  Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch and Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Peter Cooney"
543,"Gene Seymour is a film critic who has written about music, movies and culture for The New York Times, Newsday, Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.  (CNN)""Moonlight"" won. Let's be very clear about that before we talk about anything else. The same Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that has bestowed its best picture award to such glossy, hallowed artifacts as ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""An American in Paris"" and ""The Godfather"" this year gave its biggest prize to a small, critically acclaimed and artistically daring film about a troubled African-American youth struggling with a broken home, confronting his sexuality and stalked by the prospect of violence. The significance of this best picture award can't be understated and its essence, the potential broadening of storytelling possibilities for American movies, was best summarized earlier in the evening when ""Moonlight"" collected the best adapted screenplay Oscar for director Barry Jenkins and co-producer Tarell Alvin McCraney, who wrote the original semi-autobiographical stage play ""In Moonlight, Black Boys Look Blue."" ""This goes out to all those black and brown boys and girls and non-gender conforming, who don't see themselves, we're trying to show you and us,"" McCraney said in their acceptance speech. At that point in the 89th annual Academy Awards, already groundbreaking in its broad presence of African-American nominees in several categories, many in the audience and millions watching on television believed that would be the only other major award ""Moonlight"" would collect -- besides the best supporting actor prize won by Mahershala Ali for playing the gangster who takes the baffled young protagonist under his care. With all these potentially transformative moments in play, it's a shame that all people will talk about, from this day forward, is what led to the best picture award being announced twice; first as a mistake, then as a correction. At the center of it all was Warren Beatty, who proved to have impeccable comic timing without trying to be funny. Let's see if we can piece this together: Beatty and Faye Dunaway, his co-star from the 50-year-old classic ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" were given the honor of presenting the climactic award. As the 79-year-old Beatty opened the envelope, he seemed to have a senior moment, nervously grinning, visibly struggling with whatever was on the card. At that moment, he resembled nothing so much as the manic and suicidal senator from his 1998 movie, ""Bulworth,"" looking as if he were going to trip over his shoes. The problem was simple: Somebody had handed him the envelope that earlier announced Emma Stone as the best actress winner for ""La La Land."" Seeing Beatty's bafflement, Dunaway genially muttered what sounded like ""You're impossible, Warren!"" before taking hold of the envelope and reading what by that point everybody believed was the inevitable winner: ""La La Land,"" the musical romance that had already collected several Oscars, including Stone's and a best director prize for Damien Chazelle. Chaos ensued. The cast and crew of ""La La Land"" took the stage and in what seemed like seconds, the correct envelope found its way to the stage and a stunned, but gracious cast and crew of ""La La Land"" gave way to a stunned, yet joyous cast and crew of ""Moonlight.""   Up until its strange ending, this year's Oscar ceremony had already been an above-average clutter of topical humor and sincerely noteworthy moments: the first Muslim actor to win an Academy Award; ""The White Helmets"" -- a documentary about the volunteers of the same name saving lives in Syria -- winning a first Oscar for Netflix; Iranian director Ashgar Farhadi boycotting the ceremony in protest of Trump's Travel ban before winning Best Foreign Language Film; and Jimmy Kimmel mocking the President's abusive tweets about Meryl Streep before tweeting the suspiciously silent President to check he was OK.  And though some acceptance speeches were too long, others were eloquent and touching: among the best came from Stone, Jenkins, Ali and Viola Davis, whose Best Supporting Actress win for ""Fences"" made her the first African American actress to achieve the Tony-Emmy-Oscar trifecta.  Maybe that's how history is made: Sneaking up behind somebody else's mistakes. We'll have to wait and see if history's signals have sunk deep enough into Hollywood's teeming, bemused brain. "

545,"LOS ANGELES/SHENZHEN (Reuters) - Air freight rates are skyrocketing after the grounding of many passenger flights in Asia has left shippers scrambling to book limited spots on cargo planes as Chinese industrial production restarts, according to industry insiders. About half of the air cargo carried worldwide normally flies in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters. But deep flight cuts in response to the coronavirus outbreak have made the market more dependent on freight haulers. Freight forwarder Agility Logistics said on its website that China’s air cargo capacity was down 39% in February relative to last year because of the passenger flight cuts. Shippers wishing to rush products out of China by air face sticker shock, said Refael Elbaz, chief executive of Israel-based Unicargo, which specializes in freight forwarding for Amazon.com sellers. “The price is three times higher – at least - because there is just no capacity,” Elbaz said. Freight Investor Services said in an update to clients on Monday that cargo pricing on China-to-U.S. routes had reached “abnormal highs” and that intra-Asia traffic was up by 22% over the previous week. TAC Index data shows China-U.S. cargo rates have risen by 27% over the last two weeks to $3.50 a kilogram. The price surge will benefit freight haulers and help cargo-heavy Asian airlines like Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK), Korean Air Lines Co Ltd (003490.KS) and Japan’s ANA Holdings Inc (9202.T) offset some of the steep revenue losses from halting many of their passenger flights. Chris Mu, who runs a small logistics company in Shenzhen, China, that often uses air transport to supply Amazon (AMZN.O) sellers in Europe and to transport UK-made car parts for assembly in China, said prices had tripled since before the Lunar New Year and are rising by the hour. “With reduced options, we have to take whatever we can get, flying goods from the UK to the Netherlands, then from Liege in Belgium to Nanchang in Jiangxi province, just to get them to a factory in Shanghai,” Mu said. “For the airlines, it’s fine because they’re still making money, but it’s the middlemen like us who are bearing the costs, and we don’t like to go to our customers every day and tell them the price has gone up.” DHL’s express volumes have started to recover in China and the company is putting planes back into the network, Deutsche Post AG (DPWGn.DE) finance chief Melanie Kreis said on Tuesday, noting that its fleet is a major asset given the grounding of many passenger planes. In mainland China, the number of freighter arrivals has increased in recent weeks as factories resumed production. China’s aviation regulator said the number of freighter flights was expected to reach 870 this week, up from 788 in the week starting Feb. 17. “The number of air charter requests we’ve gotten in the past week are more than the number we’ve received in a normal quarter,” said Brian Bourke, chief growth officer at SEKO Logistics, a Chicago-based freight forwarder. Most of those requests involved moving goods from China to the United States, he said. (This story corrects TAC Index cargo rates in paragraph 6.)

548,"Centrist Democrats said Thursday they have the votes to block an emergency border funding bill favored by Speaker Nancy PelosiNancy PelosiJohnson eyes Irish border in Brexit negotiations Mueller report fades from political conversation Five key players in Trump's trade battles MORE (D-Calif.) and liberals in the caucus. The moderate Democrats are wary that the partisan standoff over new language to protect migrant children — language demanded by liberals — will sink negotiations and force vulnerable lawmakers to go home to face voters outraged over the escalating humanitarian crisis on the southern border. Since Wednesday, when the Senate passed a $4.6 billion border bill with overwhelming bipartisan support, swing-district Democrats — a group known as ""front-liners"" — have joined forces with other moderate lawmakers to press Pelosi and party leaders to bring that legislation to the House floor. Pelosi has so far refused, siding with the liberal wing of the party in demanding additional language providing for the explicit protection of the migrant children. Democrats had planned to vote on their amended bill Thursday afternoon. Hours before the vote, however, Rep. Josh GottheimerJoshua (Josh) GottheimerRepublicans plot comeback in New Jersey Assault weapons ban picks up steam in Congress The 11 House Dems from Trump districts who support assault weapons ban MORE (D-N.J.), a leader of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, told Pelosi that's he has rallied enough moderate Democrats to take down the rule on the amended House bill, according to a source familiar with that exchange.“There’s a feeling we’re going 2 end up with the Senate bill anyway so let’s just get on w/ it,” the source said in a text message to The Hill. The news was first reported by The Washington Post. The threatened opposition caused Democratic leaders to yank their rule from the floor, while party leaders huddled in Pelosi's office in search of a path forward. Pelosi has called for Senate GOP leaders to sit down for conference negotiations in search of a compromise between the competing versions of the emergency border legislation. Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellPelosi, Schumer press for gun screenings as Trump inches away The malware election: Returning to paper ballots only way to prevent hacking First House Republican backs bill banning assault weapons MORE (R-Ky.) has refused to do so, insisting the House take up the Senate bill as is.  And an increasing number of moderate Democrats are siding with McConnell. ""Children are suffering at the border and we must act now to stop it. The House should vote to approve the Senate version of the bill that addresses the Central American refugee crisis at the border and helps the kids living in unsafe and unacceptable conditions,"" tweeted freshman Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah). ""The thinking there is that if progressives force us to go home without addressing the border crisis ... that's a real problem,"" said a senior Democratic aide associated with the moderate wing of the party. The front-line members are particularly wary of liberal-backed language in the House bill that cuts funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — a provision that could lead to GOP attack ads against vulnerable Democrats. ""That is terrible policy, terrible politics all around for many of these front-line members,"" the aide said.

549,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have very different views on how to manage health care in the US. Clinton has made many claims and statements about the issue. CNN's Reality Check Team put her statements and assertions to the test. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speech and selected key statements, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated. Reality Check: Clinton on Obamacare insuring African-Americans  February 11, 2016 By Kate Grise, CNN During Thursday's Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton said that ""the Affordable Care Act has helped more African-Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of."" While there is no doubt that the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare -- helped a large number of African-Americans get health insurance, the legislation has actually resulted in more Latino adults gaining coverage than any other group. By the end of 2015, the uninsured rate for Latinos had declined 7.8% since 2013, according Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. During the same time frame, the uninsured rate among African-Americans dropped 7.4 percentage points. Open enrollment for 2016 recently ended, but the federal government has not yet released official data about the enrollment totals. The Affordable Care Act has been criticized for creating a ""coverage gap"" that many African-Americans fall into. People are at risk of falling into this coverage gap when they are make too much money to qualify for Medicaid programs in states that chose not to expand their programs, but not enough to qualify for subsidized insurance on the federal health care exchanges. The Affordable Care Act was engineered to help people who were not covered by Medicaid expansion be able to afford coverage in the market place, but there are 19 states that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility. It is in those states that the coverage gap appears. According to a study by the Pew Charitable Trusts, 1.4 million of the 4 million Americans in the coverage gap are black. At the time of the study published in January 2015, 23 states had not expanded Medicaid, so the coverage gap may have shrunk since then. When Obamacare first rolled out, Latinos were less likely to enroll in the federal exchange, even though the administration put a lot of emphasis on reaching the Latino community -- with a Spanish-language site and a call center with representatives fluent in Spanish. It would certainly be unfair to say that the Affordable Care Act has not helped many African-Americans gain coverage, but the legislation has helped more Latinos get coverage than any other group. Verdict: FALSE Reality Check: Clinton on drug overdose deaths in New Hampshire  February 3, 2016 By Lisa Rose, CNN After taking a question on the topic of medical marijuana, Clinton expressed concern about substance abuse in New Hampshire. She said drug overdoses are a leading cause of death in the state, adding, ""There have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes."" Clinton is correct in that assessment, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2014, 334 people died of drug overdoses in New Hampshire, according to the CDC. There were 95 traffic fatalities in New Hampshire the same year, according to the NHTSA. Although it's questionable to conflate the topics of medical marijuana and opioid addiction, Clinton's numbers are on the mark. We rate her claim TRUE. Reality Check: Clinton on numbers of people with health coverage  January 17, 2016 By Nadia Kounang, CNN Clinton cited the Affordable Care Act as providing 19 million more Americans with insurance since its inception. However, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, only 17.6 million more Americans have been added to the rolls. Clinton may have been referring to a June 2015 Congressional Budget Office report, which estimates that if the ACA was repealed, 19 million Americans would lose health care coverage. Verdict: FALSE Reality Check: Clinton on health care costs  January 17, 2016 By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney In defending the Affordable Care Act, Clinton said, ""We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years."" First of all, it's the annual growth in health care costs that had been at the lowest rate since the federal government began keeping records in 1960, not the costs themselves. It's true that the growth in health care spending was at historically low levels of about 4% for several years following the Great Recession, according to federal statistics. But Obamacare doesn't deserve the majority of the credit, experts say. About three-quarters of the slowdown was due to the weak economy, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Altarum Institute, a health research group, concluded in a 2013 report. The rest stemmed from efforts to keep spending down, including measures introduced under Obamacare. Also, the growth rate of health care spending is on the rise. In 2014, expenditures grew by 5.3%, driven primarily by the 8.7 million people who gained health insurance through Obamacare and by rapidly rising prescription drug costs. And the growth in spending is expected to pick up in coming years. Verdict: FALSE Reality check: Clinton on drug prices  December 19, 2015 By Debra Goldschmidt, CNN Clinton said, ""I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems. We end up paying the highest prices in the world."" Americans pay some of the highest prices for prescription medications -- two to six times more for brand-name prescription drugs, according to the International Federation of Health Plans. For example, the arthritis drug Humira costs Americans $2,246 for a one-month prescription, compared to $881 in Switzerland and $1,102 in England. Medicare, the largest provider of medications, is prohibited from negotiating prices with drug companies. Some lawmakers have argued this is what's behind the high prices. The pharmaceutical industry group PhRMA says the high prices are due to the cost of research and development to bring drugs to the market. Prescription drug spending increased 11.4% in 2014 and 9.6% in 2015 after steadily declining from 2000 to 2013, according to the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker. The group attributes this to patents expiring and decreases in generic drug prices. Verdict: TRUE "

When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Killerman,” Malik Bader’s latest super-violent crime thriller (after the brutal “Cash Only” in 2016), starts out slow and sticky, then gradually gathers steam and substance. The result might feel overlong and overwrought; yet thanks to Bader’s clever plotting and fruity dialogue — as well as strong supporting players — this grimy picture climaxes more satisfyingly than expected. Smack in the center is Moe Diamond (a guarded Liam Hemsworth), an ambitious Manhattan jeweler and sought-after money launderer. When his friend and partner, Skunk (Emory Cohen), suggests using a multimillion-dollar stash for a quick drug deal, Moe is wary: The money is being held for Skunk’s skeevy Uncle Nestor (Zlatko Buric), a ruthless gangster who plans to use it to purchase politicians. When the deal inevitably goes pear-shaped, a hairy car chase leaves Moe with amnesia and Skunk in the clutches of a passel of corrupt cops. The pair’s fortunes only deteriorate from there, as Moe struggles to recall events before the accident and Skunk labors to avoid becoming an attack dog’s dinner. But “Killerman” — you’ll find the title isn’t as hokey as it first appears — offers creative justification for Moe’s clichéd memory wipe with a cool twist that few will see coming. Energetically shot by Ken Seng using Super 16-millimeter film, “Killerman” looks sharp and shadowy, its texture pleasingly grainy and soaked in testosterone. This is the kind of movie where romance is signaled by a swollen belly and sex is a hasty knee-trembler against a wall; but when torture and decapitation are on the menu, who has time for love?

555,"GENEVA (Reuters) - A senior U.S. arms control official said on Tuesday that Iran’s missile program is destabilizing the Middle East and raising the risk of a “regional arms race” through the provision of such weapons to armed groups in Lebanon and Yemen. U.S. President Donald Trump said when he quit a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions against Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear activities that it failed to rein in Iran’s missile program or curb its regional meddling. The United States has accused Iran of defying a U.N. Security Council resolution by carrying out a ballistic missile test and two satellite launches since December. “Iran’s missile program is a key contributor to increased tensions and destabilization in the region, increasing the risk of a regional arms race,” Yleem Poblete, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, said in a speech to the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament. “Iran must immediately cease activities related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and halt the proliferation of missiles and missile technology to terror groups and other non-state actors,” she said, denouncing Iran’s support to the Houthi movement in Yemen and to Hezbollah in Lebanon. She said Iran had provided ballistic missiles to the Houthis that were fired into Saudi Arabia and unmanned aerial systems to Houthi groups that enable strikes against land-based targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. “We are committed to aggressively countering Iran’s regional proliferation of ballistic missiles and its unlawful arms transfers,” she added. Poblete urged “all responsible countries” to enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions restricting the transfer of missile-related technologies to Iran. She further accused Iran of “pursuing pharmaceutical-based agents for offensive purposes”, but did not elaborate. An Iranian diplomat took the floor to reject her remarks as “cheap, unprofessional, false, irrelevant and pathetic” and accused the United States of “sabotaging” the Geneva forum. “We should all be truly worried about the U.S. representative’s misbehavior as we all warn that they may turn violent since they lack any human logic to talk and listen in a normal manner as we are used to,” he said.

556,"The unique American right to privacy – the Constitutional right to be “secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects” birthed as a direct response to the British crown’s unfettered “general warrant” rights to search colonial homes is so fundamental today that nary a politician will seek to question it.  The same can be said for our First Amendment’s freedom of speech and the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. This is what makes so amazing how the FCC might be thumbing its nose at all three core principles in its latest “privacy rulemaking.”  And the noting of this came in a major broadside delivered by the most revered constitutional scholar of the day – Harvard Law School’s Laurence Tribe. In a major speech before the Media Institute, Tribe says that the effort by the FCC to strictly regulate some Internet companies’ privacy practices and not others is an affront – one that will not survive constitutional scrutiny.  A patchwork of stricter rules for network providers than for Internet “edge” companies will create an incomprehensible mess of privacy confusion for consumers while shamelessly discriminating, without any justification, between internet companies when it comes the use of data.   Tribe finds this approach so odious that he hardly minces words. [T]he FCC’s proposed rules almost certainly could not survive any meaningful degree of First Amendment scrutiny . . . .  By essentially blocking broadband provider entry into the online advertising market and singling out new entrants in the online advertising space for regulatory obstacles more stringent than those applicable to the established market leaders – market leaders whose threat to privacy concerns is obviously no less than what is posed by the new kids on the block – the FCC’s proposal is exposed as an Emperor Who Has No Clothes. It’s a nakedly anti-consumer measure, rather than a pro-privacy measure, and it can’t survive First Amendment scrutiny. The rules are a bad idea – as dozens of experts, academics, former government officials, and even other Obama Administrations have told the FCC.  But for Tribe, the problem’s even worse. The proposal is an attack on our most basic First Amendment and Equal Protection principles and is clearly unconstitutional.  That puts the FCC in a very difficult position – it is one thing to adopt bad policy, but another to knowingly enact unconstitutional rules. As Professor Tribe explains: I must speak out whenever I conclude that the freedoms of expression are genuinely compromised . . . .   That’s really why I briefed and argued a case that won in the Tenth Circuit against the FCC in 1999. In a case called “US West v FCC”, I persuaded the U.S. Court of Appeals to throw out privacy rules that had been adopted by the FCC . . . . It was very similar really to the rules involved here. . . . Now the newly proposed privacy rules for broadband internet providers are at least as clearly unconstitutional. They’re just a re-incarnation on steroids of the regulations that the Tenth Circuit held invalid. Tribe argues that these rules run afoul of years of Supreme Court precedent holding that speech cannot be subjected to “opt in” rules that let listeners shut down debate before it even gets started.  If the government forces speakers to get consent before speaking, it undermines public discussion and allows dangerous inertia to shape our discourse: For many decades, really almost for eighty years, the Court has been sensitive to the psychological and economic realities of inertia. It has invariably recognized the virtues of a regulatory regime in which the fall-back presumption or baseline, if you will, is the presumption that one is permitted to engage in speech and in the processing of information that goes into speech, unless someone with a protected stake in that information, a privacy stake or a proprietary stake, says no – rather than the other way around -- rather than a prohibition against speech and information processing unless a protected individual says yes. . . . Efforts to solicit opt-ins from one’s potential audience are often not worth the cost. Doing so for the small percentage of likely affirmative responses will simply be too expensive to be worthwhile. The result will be artificial inefficiencies introduced into the flow of truthful and valuable information, and thus an unnecessary blockage to the free flow of that information. And that’s exactly the result the FCC rule I’ve been discussing would inevitably yield.   The (now digital) filing cabinets of our executive branch agencies overflow with filings and comments and position papers on every issue under the sun.  But some views and perspectives rise above the ordinary back and forth.  That is the case with Professor Tribe’s determination that the FCC’s proposed broadband privacy rules are unconstitutional – an analysis that demands the FCC return to first principles and craft new rules that respect our basic constitutional guarantees.

558,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed (9984.T) Oyo Hotels and Homes is laying off hundreds of employees in India, according to a source and an internal memo seen by Reuters, as the loss-making hotel chain cuts costs in pursuit of profits. The move is part of a larger priority to drive profitability and sustainable growth, following a cash-guzzling expansion spree that took Oyo to dozens of new markets including China and the United States, an email from Chief Executive Ritesh Agarwal to Oyo employees on Monday showed. “Some roles at OYO will become redundant as we further drive tech-enabled synergy, enhanced efficiency and remove duplication of effort across businesses or geographies,” Agarwal wrote. “As a result, we are asking some of our impacted colleagues to move to a new career outside of OYO.” The email did not disclose the number of layoffs. However, a person briefed on the matter said the layoffs impact more than 1,000 employees in India across senior, mid-level and junior positions. Four Oyo employees in the Indian cities of Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and the company’s headquarters in Gurugram confirmed that employees were being asked to leave. Local media have reported that Oyo was laying off anywhere between 1,000 and 2,000 employees in the country. An Oyo representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The cost-cutting effort comes as Oyo’s biggest investor SoftBank faces setbacks in some of its marquee investments, such as office-sharing startup WeWork, which it is bailing out after a failed public listing. Other investments by the Japanese technology giant, including Uber (UBER.N), have also seen their valuations drop sharply. Oyo, founded by Agarwal in 2013, has in particular been hit by a volley of unfavorable headlines in recent months. It faces a growing backlash from several of its hotel partners, while internal projections have shown that Oyo may not make a profit in its two biggest markets until 2022, even as losses spiral. Oyo's rapid growth was fueled in part by questionable practices, that included giving free lodging to police to deter trouble over illegal rooms, the New York Times reported here this month. “We take all the allegations very seriously and are looking into each and every one,” Agarwal wrote in Monday’s email. He also said the company would focus on “profitable locations and buildings, and avoid growth that dilutes our margins” and that Oyo would work to “further reduce operating costs.” Reporting by Sachin Ravikumar and Maria Ponnezhath in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Chandini Monnappa; Editing by Anil D'Silva"

561,"Open, a Bangalore-based startup that operates a “neo-bank” to help businesses automate and run their finances, has bagged $30 million in a new funding round as investors look to replicate a globally tried and tested business idea in emerging markets. The Series B financing round for the two-year-old startup was led by Tiger Global with Tanglin Venture Partners Advisors and existing investors 3one4 Capital, Speedinvest, BetterCapital AngelList Syndicate also participating in it. The new round valued Open at $150 million, a person familiar with the matter said. The startup has raised about $37 million to date. Open operates as a neo-bank that offers nearly all the features of the bank with additional tools to serve the needs of a business. Millions of small and medium sized businesses in India struggle with maintaining multiple bank accounts, bookkeeping of their daily spending, and bandying out payments to employees. Open offers them a platform that automates much of this task. It lets them keep track of each transaction — who it came from, where it is going, and what sales it made across accounts. “We have a small business owner from Ahmedabad on our platform. They see 59 transactions from their customers in its bank account every few hours. Prior to using our service, they were juggling all day to figure out where these transactions originated from or went to,” he explained. “Because on their bank statement, they only see one-line description of a transaction’s detail.” Traditional banks have either not addressed these small needs, or charge huge amount for their own solutions that is not feasible for a small business, he added. The startup says it already has over 100,000 customers, with as many as 20,000 coming onboard each month of late. It processes about $5 billion in transactions each year. In an interview with TechCrunch, Anish Achuthan, founder and CEO of Open, said the startup saw an opportunity to serve the businesses and wanted to open a better bank. “But building a bank in India comes with its own set of regulatory challenges, so we looked at what fintech startups were doing in other parts of the world for inspiration,” he said. And it found that inspiration quickly enough. One of its early investors is Speedinvest, which has funded Tide and N26 ‘neo-banks’ in European markets. In India, Open has partnered with ICICI Bank, one of the biggest banks in the nation, for creation of accounts. On ICICI Bank’s internet banking website, Open has integrated its tools including a payment gateway, Achuthan explained. Achuthan said the startup, which employs 85 people currently, will use the fresh capital to significantly expand its business — build more products, hire more people, and sign up more customers. Open will soon also launch Open+ card, a business credit card with a 30-day interest-free credit line for venture backed startups, and Layer, a programmable bank account for developers. In the next one year, the startup aims to grow its customer base to 1 million. Open raised its Series A of $5 million earlier this year. When asked if it’s a very capital intensive business, Achuthan said they needed the money to get a first-mover advantage. The startup was in talks with another investor to raise an additional $20 million, but Achuthan said they did not need that much money at this stage. Open today competes with a handful of startups including InstantPay, but Achuthan said much of the market remains untapped."
562,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Open Road Films, a small movie producer founded by two theater chains just five years ago, upstaged Hollywood’s big studios on Sunday by winning the coveted best picture award and a likely sales boost for its Catholic Church scandal drama “Spotlight”. Voters for the film industry’s top awards spread the accolades among several films, including 20th Century Fox’s sweeping survival story “The Revenant”, which won best director, best cinematography and best actor for Leonardo DiCaprio. The most-honored film was “Mad Max: Fury Road” from Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros., which took home six Oscars in technical categories. Movie studios mount multi-million-dollar campaigns for their Oscar contenders. The awards lend prestige along with bragging rights that the studios can use in advertising. Roughly 40 million people in the United States watch the Oscars telecast each year. The recognition is expected to lift theater, DVD and digital sales of the winners, analysts said. Last year’s winner, “Birdman”, sold $4.6 million worth of tickets after the award, about 11 percent of its total sales, according to comScore data. This year’s best picture trophy is a major victory for Open Road, formed in 2011 as a joint venture by Regal Entertainment Group and AMC Entertainment. AMC is now owned by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, part of the growing investment in Hollywood by Chinese companies. Open Road’s goal was to finance smaller-budget movies at a time when big studios turned their focus to expensive blockbusters. “Spotlight” was produced for about $20 million with Participant Media, a company founded by former eBay President Jeff Skoll to produce entertainment content that inspires social change. “Open Road and Participant Media have been great champions of the film and for creating a different option for filmmakers”, “Spotlight” producer Michael Sugar said backstage. “Spotlight” has sold $61.8 million worth of tickets at theaters worldwide. “The Revenant”, which has grossed a massive $404 million, was perfectly timed to capitalize on awards buzz, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. The film hit theaters nationwide in January right before the Oscar nominations and just after its Golden Globe wins. “It was able to catch an awards season wave”, Dergarabedian said. Among other winners on Sunday, independent studio A24 won three awards including best actress for “Room” star Brie Larson and best documentary for “Amy.” Walt Disney Co won two Oscars, including best animated feature for Pixar’s “Inside Out”.

563,"Let me say this upfront: I loved John Oliver's take down of America's (dying) newspaper industry that aired Sunday night on HBO. In an epic 20-minute rant that only he could deliver, Oliver took aim at the industry-wide struggle that has defined my professional life. ""The newspaper industry today is in big trouble,"" Oliver said. ""Papers have been closing and downsizing for years and that affects all of us."" He's right that newspapers are in big trouble. But what he gets wrong is the root cause of that trouble; he blames the consumer who won't pay for news. ""We've just grown accustomed to getting our news for free, and the longer we get something for free, the less willing we are to pay for it,"" Oliver said. Only, that analysis is skin-deep. One news industry veteran, who has long since ditched newspapers for radio, once summed up the situation perfectly for me. ""It's not that newspapers don't make money. They just don't make enough money for their greedy owners."" Historically, newspapers have had sky-high profit margins. At their peak in the late 90's, seven publicly traded media companies saw profit margins at nearly 30%. The now-defunct American Journalism Review even reported in October 1994 that the Warren Buffett-owned Buffalo News had a 34.6% profit margin. That's luxury goods-level margins. Louis Vuitton, ranked at #19 on Forbes' most valuable brands list, has ""profit margins north of 30%."" For comparison, both Exxon Mobil and Walmart had profit margins last quarter below 3%. Newspapers were printing presses of gold, in no small part because most operated as near monopolies in most cities and towns. Until, that is, the internet changed everything.  As newspaper ads dried up and the classified section imploded, digital pennies replaced print dollars (to steal Jeff Zucker's phrase). And then newspaper company executives made a bad situation worse. Nationwide, newspapers started cutting costs to preserve no-longer-sustainable profit margins. And so began the local news death spiral. With revenue declining but a greedy desire to keep margins high, companies laid off workers. That, coupled with the need to produce more digital and social content, meant less real reporting. Everybody had to do more with less. There's no good quantitative analysis of this decline, but if you come from a small town like I do, ask anybody if they still read the newspaper. Then ask why not. A Facebook group I'm in is devoted to ""compliments and complaints"" in my West Virginia hometown. One day, a neighbor said this:   ""We are long-time subscribers to our local newspaper. This is more of a concern than a complaint, but here goes... Why are so many actual 'news' stories missing from the same paper? Neighborhood thefts, vandalism, accidents, fires... this is all news worthy and should be published for the public. There may be a story here and there, but for the most part they are non-existent."" That unleashed a slew of complaints about the only news source in this little town.  The most important complaint was this: ""My subscription is over soon, and I won't resubscribe. Our local paper is terrible and it doesn't have to be."" Circulation to America's newspapers has plummeted, in no small part I believe because of the decreasing relevancy of their content.  It's not because people won't pay for local news, as John Oliver claimed. It's because regional and local newspapers have declined in quality as a result of the greed of our owners. And so the cycle continued. People unsubscribe. Revenues fall again. More cuts. Rinse and repeat.   I know this decline first hand. This industry-wide struggle has also defined my personal life. My mother is a long-time reporter in West Virginia. When she worked at that above-mentioned newspaper in the 90's, she actually produced a 50-article investigative series about acid drainage from abandoned coal mines. When she left a different paper, the Martinsburg, W.Va., Journal, earlier this year to work on a project with me, she was making just over $12 an hour.  Keep in mind she has spent the last several years bringing light to West Virginia’s heroin epidemic, well before anybody else did so. Coverage, by the way, that just won several awards from the state press association. But her hard work was never financially rewarded. But, in our corporate overlords' defense, it really is hard to give up a high profit margin business for a low margin one.  Ogden Newspapers owns the Martinsburg Journal. Ogden's CEO Robert Nutting was worth over a billion dollars in 2012, according to CNBC. Pittsburghers will know Nutting as the principal owner of the Pirates, but a majority of his wealth still came from the papers. Who wants to drive a Honda when you used to drive a Mercedes? I get it. Despite the embrace of this preserve-the-margin-at-any-cost strategy, margins have steadily declined. By 2012, the large chains like Gannett and McClatchy had dropped to 9.9% and 15% respectively. Today the largest publicly traded newspaper chains have settled down to about 5-10% margins. One longtime newspaper turned digital exec told me he thinks they will stay put there. But what would have happened if during those days of feast, newspaper companies invested in digital and talent, thus reducing the short term profit margins for long term stability? How then might we be doing in these days of famine? Would circulation at medium and small newspapers have fallen off the same cliff? We probably will never know. I just hope it's not too late for our cities and towns, because their greed has indeed affected all of us."
564,"IT WAS WHEN Nasrin Khaleque got a job that she realised her marriage “was not normal”. None of her female colleagues seemed to have husbands who checked to see what they were up to ten times a day, or who objected if they went out for coffee after work. She told her husband she wanted a divorce. “I realised I didn’t have to put up with it,” she says. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the number of applications for divorce has increased by 34% in the past seven years. More and more are filed by women, especially in cities. Not long ago, women could not initiate divorces. During marriage ceremonies, the presiding registrar would ask the husband and his family if they wanted to give the bride the right to seek a divorce, says Fawzia Karim Firoze, president of the Bangladesh National Woman Lawyers’ Association. “Of course many, if not most, families said ‘no’.” A legal change means women now enjoy the right as a matter of course. But they still have to give a reason for wanting a divorce, such as infidelity. Men do not. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. For the poorest and the richest, says Mrs Firoze, divorce was never that unusual. Among the poor, marriages are seldom official, allowing men to abandon one wife for another easily. As for the rich, “Wealth buys certain freedoms.” But among the middle classes, divorce has been rare: “They face the most stigma. What will my family say? What will other people say?” That is changing. The rate of divorce is increasing across the board, but particularly among the middle classes, according to Tania Haque of Dhaka University. Internet access and social media mean women are more easily able to communicate with friends and to lead lives outside their marriage. “This makes the prospect of divorce seem less daunting.” With greater access to a world outside the home come changing expectations. Ms Haque believes that popular Indian soap operas have helped to propagate a more liberated world view. For both men and women, she adds, social media have also made it easier to have affairs. Sabrina Saba Mumu, who left her husband after he had an affair, says that her mother’s generation would have tolerated their husbands’ infidelities. She and her friends are less accepting. “We want marriages that are equal partnerships,” she adds, “not a relationship where the man is the boss.” That means sharing housework and child care, too. Most importantly, more and more women have jobs. In 1974 women were just 4% of the labour force. In 2016 they were 36% of it. Much of this is down to the booming garment industry, which employs mostly women. Earning a salary makes leaving a bad marriage financially possible. Many men are unhappy about these changes. Ms Saba Mumu says her husband wanted her to look after him the way his mother did, but, as a successful research scientist, she “didn’t have time to cook all his meals and do everything else he asked”. Miss Khaleque’s husband thought that because she came from a small town she “wouldn’t be so ambitious”. He forced her to wear a headscarf to work and forbade her from talking to male colleagues. After she had their daughter, he tried to stop her working altogether, saying that she belonged at home. Religious groups are also troubled. One of the most prominent, Hefazat-e-Islam (“Protectors of Islam”), formed in 2010 partly in response to plans to change inheritance laws to make them more favourable to women. When Hefazat supporters later marched on the capital calling for stringent segregation of the sexes, that was widely perceived as a call for women to stay at home, especially by the city’s many female garment-workers. Hefazat also rails against adultery and “shamelessness”. Hefazat’s hectoring has not stopped the divorce rate from rising. But the social stigma for men and, especially, women who seek divorce remains strong. “In hindsight leaving was the easy part,” says Miss Khaleque. “My family’s judgment since has been harder to take.”"
565,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — What a difference a phone call makes. In Taiwan — rendered nearly invisible in global affairs by decades of accommodation to Chinese pressure — the reaction to the call between President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan and President-elect Donald J. Trump late last week has been broadly positive, if tinged with caution. Ms. Tsai took office in May with a mandate to reduce Taiwan’s economic reliance and close political ties with Beijing. China claims Taiwan as its territory and threatens to use force if Taipei officially acknowledges its de facto sovereignty. At her inauguration, Ms. Tsai said she wanted to improve relations with China, while also deepening ties with the United States and Japan. Ms. Tsai has moved her party, the Democratic Progressive Party, away from its pro-independence roots to a more nuanced form of Taiwan nationalism. The party’s charter still features a clause advocating eventual official independence in the form of a Republic of Taiwan, although in July Ms. Tsai proposed replacing the clause with language that favors maintaining the status quo. On Sunday, Hung Hsiu-chu, the chairwoman of the opposition Nationalist party, or Kuomintang, said she was glad to learn of Mr. Trump’s support for Taiwan. “I am happy to see anything good for Taiwan,” the KMT’s website quoted Ms. Hung as saying. Ms. Hung’s comment was notable because she has previously advocated unification with China. Her party lost the presidency this year after eight years of moving closer to Beijing, which did not reduce its threat to Taiwan. China has more than 1,500 missiles pointed across the Taiwan Strait. In interviews in Taipei, the capital, on Monday, residents said they were pleased about the phone call. “I think that for the majority of Taiwanese people, this is the happiest thing that’s happened to us since 1978, before the U.S. broke off diplomatic relations,” Hsieh Jin-ho, a publisher and commentator, said in a phone interview. The United States formally recognized the People’s Republic of China in 1979, abrogating its ties with Taiwan under the One China policy. Mr. Hsieh added that in general, Taiwanese had two different takeaways from the call. “One conclusion is that Taiwan needs to seize this opportunity in order to upgrade to fuller relations with the U.S. and expand its international friendly relations,” he said. “Another group of people fear that China’s continually increasing pressure will grow even larger” and threaten Taiwan’s future. Speaking at her cafe in Taipei’s Zhongshan district, Annie Hsieh, unrelated to Mr. Hsieh, smiled when asked about the call. “I think it’s great,” Ms. Hsieh said. “Reading that it’s the first time in 37 years that the Taiwanese president and American president-elect have spoken, I feel like it’s major progress by the new government.” Chen Hui-ling, a lawyer, praised Ms. Tsai, whose party controls Taiwan’s presidency and legislature for the first time. “People who voted for the D.P.P. are paying attention to what it’s doing,” she said. “They’re looking to see if it will do something courageous, something different from the past.” Ms. Chen said she was struck by how most European lawyers she encountered on a recent business trip to London knew little about Taiwan. “They may have heard that there are some problems between Taiwan and China, but that’s all they know,” she said. Albert King, a fund manager, said the call was the main subject of conversation among his friends and associates. “I think all Taiwanese are happy to see the president-elect of the United States say it’s O.K. to say ‘president of Taiwan’ or talk to the Taiwanese people as if we are a normal country,” he said. “I don’t know how Americans look at this, but I think the president-elect has won the hearts of us Taiwanese.” Yet he also sounded a note of caution. “We all know from our history that international politics is about realpolitik,” he said. “We have good faith, but we’ll refrain from wishful thinking.” In 1978, when Washington announced it would shift official recognition of China to Beijing, it sent Taiwan into the diplomatic wilderness in which it still resides. Since then, Taiwan has evolved from a oppressive martial state into a wealthy, progressive democracy. “It’s a long-awaited vindication of our denial by the world,” Mr. King said of the Tsai-Trump call. “Even after we’ve achieved so much as a democracy, as a society, as an economy, we are not treated as equal to other countries.” Although happy with Taiwan’s moment in the sun, Jodie Lee, who works at an international nongovernmental organization in Taipei, is reluctant to place much faith in Mr. Trump. “Does this mean Trump is going to restore relations with Taiwan?” Ms. Lee asked. “Or did he only pick up the phone because the U.S. sells us a lot of weapons?” Mr. King described an increasingly unpredictable regional political environment, with the Philippines entering China’s orbit, while Beijing’s relations with Singapore have soured. And China will make important leadership changes next year. “It’s all very delicate right now, so I’m not surprised that China has been showing self-restraint,” Mr. King said. “I think that’s a good sign, but I would not be surprised if they change their mind and decide to react very strongly.” “The tectonic plates are shifting, we know it will bring earthquakes,” he said. “Risk is definitely rising — I’m an investor, I can see that.”"

A report on Thursday said China had invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing, soothing investor nerves after Reuters reported on Wednesday that the trade deal could slide into next year.

""We've achieved tremendous success. I think we've been about as active as you can possibly be at a just about record-setting pace."" Like many of Trump's claims, there's a grain of truth here: The president has signed a lot of bills. In his first 100 days, Trump signed more bills into law than all but two presidents in the last 84 years; since that point, he's continued to add to that number, signing a total of 39 bills, according to GovTrack (actually, five more than he bragged Monday when he said it was more than 34.) But a stack of paper does not productivity make: As PolitiFact noted previously, ""None of the bills Trump has signed into law are particularly significant."" Three of those bills were appointing three members to the Smithsonian's board, another approved a war memorial, a fifth promoted women in entrepreneurship, and a sixth encouraged the display of the American flag on Vietnam War Veterans Day. While their bill signings may trail Trump's, many of his predecessors won significant legislative achievements in their first 100 days. Obama signed an $800 billion stimulus. Bill Clinton inked the Family Medical Leave Act. Lyndon Johnson championed the stalled Civil Rights Act. John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps. Trump has indeed taken early steps on a slew of his promises, but he's struggled to make substantive advancements on nearly all. A federal appeals court refused to reinstate his travel ban on residents of a group of Muslim-majority nations, dealing his second order barring certain travelers yet another legal blow. He's yet to fully repeal and replace Obamacare or secure funding from Mexico or Congress to begin any kind of meaningful border wall construction. He has made good on his promises to pull the nation out of a climate deal and one of the two trade deals he said he'd ax. He's unraveled many of his predecessor's regulations — something nearly all presidents do, when taking office from the opposing party — but he's had little legislative action on the slew of vague plans he's released on issues like infrastructure and tax reform. Most of his agenda remains just that: Plans that have yet to be accomplished."

Although Bloomberg has yet to announce whether he is running, he already receives nearly a third of the vote in a three-way race, regardless of who the Democratic and Republican nominees are.

And in a scenario in which Republican primary hopeful Marco Rubio wins his party's nomination, Bloomberg receives 28 percent of the vote, compared to Rubio’s 38 percent and Clinton’s 35 percent. These results, according to Luntz, give Bloomberg a real shot at mounting a successful White House run. “The key takeaway? There’s more than a political lane available to the former mayor; it’s an interstate highway,” he said. The poll also finds that when either Trump or Cruz is the GOP nominee, Bloomberg draws more support from Republicans than from Democrats, winning 26 and 23 percent of GOP voters, respectively. When Rubio is the GOP nominee, only 18 percent of Republicans defect to support the former mayor. Bloomberg consistently draws 18 or 19 percent of the Democratic vote from Clinton. The poll did not measure how Bloomberg does in a three-way race where presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders is the Democratic nominee.

Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade negotiations are set to happen in Shanghai this week as the two economic powerhouses seek to reach a deal to end a protracted trade dispute. The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Tuesday but said that it ""will not hesitate to take additional easing measures"" if the economy loses momentum toward achieving the target inflation rate of 2%. The Japanese central bank also said it intends to maintain the ""current extremely low levels"" of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020. The Japanese yen last traded at 108.64 against the dollar after seeing an earlier low of 108.94. Government data released earlier on Tuesday showed Japan's factory output falling more than expected in June. ""In a world whereby we're seeing synchronized monetary easing, the BOJ has got to keep up with ... the dovish tones going ahead into the second half of this year,"" Francis Tan, investment strategist at UOB Private Bank, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Tuesday. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark lending rate for the first time since 2008 by 25 basis points. Its rate decision is set to be announced on Wednesday stateside.

575,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to Nepal on Friday intent on keeping the small South Asian country away from China's grasp. The big picture: Nepal is located between the two Asian giants. It has historically been closer to India, a fellow Hindu-majority country with which it shares deep cultural and economic ties. But India is worried that Chinese investment is causing its neighbor’s loyalties to shift. Nepal's economic livelihood depends on Indian exports, tourism and remittances from its citizens working in India, says Shailesh Kumar, Asia director for the Eurasia Group. The Nepali rupee is also pegged to the Indian one. But Nepal has felt overwhelmed by Indian influence. After the 2015 Nepali earthquake, India implemented an unofficial blockade of supplies during a time of dire need to protest Nepal's treatment of its ethnically-Indian citizens. China, meanwhile, has made big-ticket offers to build roads and dams in Nepal without conditions based on Nepal's domestic politics. Every south Asian country needs infrastructure, Kumar says, but Nepal is desperate for it. While campaigning, Nepali Prime Minister K.P. Oli espoused pro-China views, vowing to restarted stalled Chinese projects, but since taking power he has shown a willingness to cooperate with India, says Kumar. Timing: Modi's trip to Nepal comes after Oli visited India last month and Modi himself went to China to meet with Xi just a few weeks ago. What to watch: ""Modi needs to make sure any drift that has been taking place ends,"" and he'll do that by offering greater Indian financing of and investment in Nepali infrastructure projects, Kumar says. Go deeper: Nepal is just one of the flash points in the India–China rivalry"

577,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will pump the proceeds from last month’s listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco into the local economy over several years, including building up the domestic defense industry amid tensions with Iran, its finance minister said on Tuesday. Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters there were “serious efforts” to reduce antagonism between Washington and Tehran after a top Iranian general was killed in a U.S. air strike and Iran retaliated with missile attacks against American bases in Iraq. “If you look at history, we in this region have managed to weather through worse geopolitical situations, including actual, real wars,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. “We in Saudi have to focus on the economy and reform ... We firmly believe the disputes can only be resolved by dialogue.” A string of attacks last year on tankers in Gulf waters and Saudi oil sites, including the world’s largest oil processing facility, pierced Saudi defenses and threatened to derail a reform agenda aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil. Riyadh and Washington blame the strikes on Iran, which denies involvement but has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz shipping channel in retaliation for sanctions placed on its crude exports by Western powers. The United States is sending additional military forces to Saudi Arabia, and France has deployed a radar system to bolster the kingdom’s air defenses. Even before the recent tensions, Riyadh had begun a drive to localize 50% of military spending led by Saudi Arabian Military Industries, owned by the state Public Investment Fund (PIF). With nearly $30 billion coming into PIF coffers from Aramco’s local share offering last month, new and existing local industries, including defense and technology, will get a boost in capital, Jadaan said. “We work with our military industry to develop our own military assets in the mid-term to deal with these risks, including investment by PIF,” he added. The Saudi economy, the largest in the Arab world, remains dominated by hydrocarbon revenues despite plans to diversify. It has suffered in recent years because of low oil prices and austerity measures aimed at reducing a huge budget deficit. Jadaan said he expected to see healthier oil prices in 2020 due to solid demand, reduced output and easing trade tensions. He also predicted a smaller deficit by the end of the year than announced last month, when Riyadh said it could face a deficit of nearly $50 billion this year. Yet the International Monetary Fund on Monday lowered its forecast for Saudi Arabia’s economic growth to 1.9% this year due to output cuts agreed last month with the OPEC+ group of oil producers. Saudi Arabia has said it expects growth of 2.3%. “Our focus is firmly on non-oil GDP growth, with focus on tourism, entertainment, sports, technology and financial sector,” Jadaan said. He said the presidency of the Group of 20 major economies, which Saudi Arabia assumed this year, was an important step towards resolving the region’s problems. “It is critical the world’s attention is brought to the Middle East,” said Jadaan. “If you deal with some of the regional problems, it will be a relief for the world.” Writing by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Mark Potter"

579,"BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Wednesday said sales rose in China in June after two consecutive months of decline, and promised to rebuild momentum in the world’s largest car market with 10 new or refreshed models in the second half of 2017. The U.S. automaker, China’s second-largest foreign brand behind Volkswagen AG, sold 285,191 vehicles in June, 4.3 percent more than in the same month last year. For January to June, sales declined 2.5 percent to roughly 1.8 million vehicles. Overall sales in China’s auto market surged by double-digits in 2016, helped by a tax cut on vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters or below. But that policy is now being phased out, leading to weaker sales. “We are pleased with the strong demand across our brands in June,” Matt Tsien, GM’s China chief, said in a statement. “Over the next six months, we will be launching 10 new and refreshed models to build on our momentum.” The launches will include an all-new Buick Regal sport sedan and a station wagon under the made-for-China budget brand Baojun. Sales growth for Japanese rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd also rose in June. Vehicle sales increased 3.7 percent in the first five months of the year, less than the 5 percent annual growth forecast by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

580,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s foreign minister defended the country’s ties with North Korea and Iran during talks on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson aimed at building robust relations between the two giant democracies. The Trump administration has launched a new U.S. effort to deepen military and economic ties with India as a way to balance China’s assertive posture across Asia. At the talks with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, both sides pledged to strengthen anti-terrorism cooperation and Tillerson said Washington stood ready to provide India with advanced military technology. “The United States supports India’s emergence as a leading power and will continue to contribute to Indian capabilities to provide security throughout the region,” Tillerson told a joint news conference with Swaraj. But the talks also touched on India’s diplomatic ties with North Korea, Swaraj said, at a time when the United States has stepped up efforts to isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. Swaraj said she told the top U.S. diplomat that some level of diplomatic presence was necessary to keep open channels of communication. “As far as the question of embassy goes, our embassy there is very small, but there is in fact an embassy,” she said. “I told Secretary Tillerson that some of their friendly countries should maintain embassies there so that some channels of communication are kept open.” India and North Korea maintain diplomatic offices in each other’s capitals, though New Delhi recently banned trade of most goods with the country, except food and medicine. Trade was minimal, Swaraj said. The focus on North Korea comes as U.S. President Donald Trump heads to China next month, where he is expected to urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to try to rein in North Korea. Tillerson, who flew in from Pakistan which he called an important U.S. ally in the restive region, also held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is driving closer ties with the United States. But India, a former leading light of the Non-Aligned Movement and which was on the opposite side of the United States during the Cold War, still remains wary of any alliances with major powers lest it affect its autonomy. India has also maintained ties with Iran which is being targeted by the Trump administration for its alleged military support of extremist groups in the Middle East and for its ballistic missile programme. India has long sourced its oil from Iran, but in recent years the two sides have been also collaborating on key infrastructure projects. New Delhi is pushing hard for the development of Chabahar port on the Iranian coast as a hub for its trade links to the resource-rich countries of central Asia and Afghanistan but the Trump administration’s tough stance has raised new concerns over the future of that project. But Tillerson struck a conciliatory stance on India’s ties with Iran, saying it wouldn’t come in the way of countries doing legitimate business there. “It is not our objective to harm the Iranian people nor is it our objective to interfere with legitimate business activities that are going on with other businesses, whether they be from Europe, India or agreements that are in place or promote economic development and activity to the benefit of our friends and allies,” he said. America’s disagreements were with the Iranian regime, and in particular the Iran Revolutionary Guard, he said. India is especially keen on the Chabahar port as a way to bypass long-time foe Pakistan which does not allow easy trade and transit arrangements to Afghanistan and beyond. Tillerson said the U.S. stood should-to-shoulder with India in the fight against terrorism which New Delhi has long said is centered in militant groups operating from inside Pakistan. He said militant groups were a threat to everyone in the region, including Pakistan itself. “Quite frankly my view - and I expressed this to the leadership of Pakistan - is we also are concerned about the stability and security of Pakistan’s government as well.” The United States has been urging Pakistan to act against the groups that operate in Afghanistan, India and inside Pakistan itself. “Terrorist safe havens will not be tolerated,” Tillerson said. Pakistan says it is doing all it can to fight the militants. Additional reporting by Aditi Shah; Writing by Sanjeev Miglani and Krishna N. Das; Editing by Nick Macfie and Clarence Fernandez"
581,"details@ (Adds quotes from White House economic adviser) NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday dangled the prospect of completing an initial trade deal with China ""soon,"" but offered no new details on negotiations in a campaign-style speech touting his administration's economic record. Markets had been on edge about Trump's highly anticipated remarks to The Economic Club of New York, but barely moved after the speech, which contained no major policy announcements. Rumors early on Tuesday that Trump might announce a venue and date for signing a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping proved unfounded. Trump said U.S. and Chinese negotiators were ""close"" to a ""phase one"" trade deal, but largely repeated well-worn rhetoric about China's ""cheating"" on trade. ""They are dying to make a deal. We're the ones that are deciding whether or not we want to make a deal,"" Trump said, echoing remarks he made on Saturday. ""We're close,"" he said. ""A significant phase one trade deal with China could happen. Could happen soon. But we will only accept a deal if it's good for the United States and our workers and our great companies."" Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods ""very substantially"" if China does not make a deal with the United States. ""And that's going to be true for other countries that mistreat us too,"" he added. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow later told CNBC that the phase one agreement could include some adjustments to tariffs already in place, but neither side would agree to such steps ""until the entire deal is put together."" U.S. stocks largely drifted sideways as Trump spoke, holding onto modest gains. The S&P 500 was up about 0.3% in afternoon trade, close to a record high. The response in bond and foreign exchange markets was equally subdued. ""The only thing that's maybe new is that he did not announce a date and a time for a signing ceremony,"" Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said of the speech. ""Where markets had been hoping for that, those hopes were dashed,"" he added, saying that buying of riskier assets faded when it became apparent that no major announcement would be made. ""GIVE ME SOME OF THAT"" Trump once again took aim at the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions that have left U.S. interest rates higher than many other economies and said he would prefer negative rates. The Fed has cut interest rates three times since July, following a string of nine increases since late 2015. Trump has repeatedly railed against the Fed for not lowering rates even more. ""Remember we are actively competing with nations that openly cut interest rates so that many are now actually getting paid when they pay off their loan, known as negative interest. Who ever heard of such a thing?"" Trump said in his remarks. ""Give me some of that. Give me some of that money. I want some of that money. Our Federal Reserve doesn't let us do it,"" he said. But Kudlow told CNBC that he did not believe negative rates were needed given the strong U.S. economic performance. ""I dont think the United states needs negatives rates ... because our economy is in very good shape,"" Kudlow said. Trump touted tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017, saying they have created an unprecedented economic boom, and said there was room for further reductions in rates too. He alluded to a Republican ""tax cut 2.0"" plan that has been stalled by Democrats in the House of Representatives. As he often has, Trump pointed to the stock market's run-up as a validation of his economic and trade policies. The S&P is up more than 36% since Trump took office, though two-thirds of that gain occurred in his first year in office before he began imposing tariffs on imports from China. Stocks have found the going far more choppy since the first wave of tariffs were imposed in 2018, though all three major indexes hit record highs last week. The latest back-and-forth between Washington and Beijing illustrates the bumpy state of play. Last week, officials from both sides said they had a deal to roll back tariffs, only to have Trump deny any deal had been agreed on. Tuesday was Trump's second appearance at the storied Economic Club of New York, which has hosted U.S. presidents including Woodrow Wilson and John F. Kennedy, as well as foreign leaders like former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev https://www.econclubny.org/legacyarchive/-/blogs/1992-mikhail-gorbachev and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang https://www.ncuscr.org/content/full-text-premier-li-keqiangs-speech.

584,"Saints Row: The Third lives again. The 2011 game comes to Nintendo Switch on May 10, and it's the same ridiculously over-the-top story of superstardom, gang warfare, and government malfeasance you remember. Or not? Even if we accept that time has actually flowed normally since early 2017 — a tall order when every day ages us all another 10 years, I know — it's been a long time since Saints Row: The Third showed up. If you're not familiar with the series, or just want to catch up, let's talk about why it matters. It's always funny to think back on how Saints Row, the series, started as an opportunistic knock-off. In 2006, the early days of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 console generation, video game fans were hungry to see what their new hardware could do. At the time, Rockstar's Grand Theft was the gold standard for big, open world action romps, but with 2004's San Andreas still fresh there was little chance of a new GTA at the time.  So along came Saints Row, the first one. It was a bit more subversive than GTA, and it took itself way less seriously. There were some rough edges, and the humor didn't really land. But it scratched an itch.  Saints Row, the series, started as an opportunistic knock-off. Saints Row 2 leaned in even harder a couple years later. It embraced the over-the-top sensibilities that the first game had merely flirted with, to great effect. The humor landed in a way that it hadn't before and the violence, more gratuitous than ever, became an integral part of the joke. That first sequel made it clear this was no mere knock-off. Volition, the series' developer, was bringing some fresh ideas to the mix and shaking up a modern open world action sub-genre that had until then been entirely the domain of the GTA games. But it wasn't until Saints Row: The Third that the series found itself. We're talking about a game whose opening mission is a blockbuster-worthy series of events in which you fight your way through an airborne cargo plane, dump everything in its hold into the skies above a major city, shoot your way through a mid-air gunfight, and then, finally, re-board the plane in an unconventional way — I won't spoil how — to make it crash. Or how about a mission that comes up shortly after where you have to crash a rooftop pool party at a penthouse apartment owned by a rival gang? You parachute in, guns a-blazing, while Kanye West's megahit-of-that-moment ""Power"" backs you up. Nothing in video games at that time felt quite so epic. Don't take it from me, though. Let's take a look at how the critics of 2011 greeted Saints Row: The Third. Writing for Giant Bomb, Alex Navarro summed up the totality of the sequel's success in two perfect sentences. Grand Theft Auto filtered through the mind of a fucking lunatic, pushed to boundaries of ludicrousness that make things like giant dildo clubs and man-launching cannons seem altogether reasonable compared with much of the other batshit nonsense going on in here. In a sense, Volition has succeeded in making the mayhem and murder simulator that Rockstar never even tried to make in the first place, and it's hard to argue that we, the video gaming public, aren't better off for it. Navarro went on to praise the story improvements, a feat he felt was pulled off by Volition's writers for ""simply refusing to care."" There is a plot to follow that unfolds over the course of three very clearly divided acts, but as Navarro pointed out ""most of it is lost amid the genuinely funny throwaway one-liners and endless gobs of insane action thrown directly at your eye sockets."" GameSpot's Carolyn Petit had much to say about the wild sense of freedom in Saints Row: The Third, starting right at the top with the game's character creator. If you choose, you can make it all the more absurd by creating a character who speaks in zombie grunts or wears an animal mascot suit (when he opts to wear anything at all). The number of character customization options is impressive, and there are no restrictions on what elements you combine. If you wish to create a blonde bombshell with a beard or a mean-looking man who sounds like a woman from Eastern Europe, you can. Seeing a man in a sexy cowgirl outfit or a woman wearing a giant Johnny Gat head in cutscenes in which everyone treats him or her as a respected gang boss is hilarious. And if you get bored with your character's current appearance, voice, or outfit, plastic surgery and clothing from the varied boutiques of Steelport cost a pittance, so you can reinvent yourself as often as you please.  That freedom, she said, also extends to the things you actually do when you're playing the game. Progression in Saints Row: The Third revolves around earning Respect, which you get from completing missions and activities. That, in turn, leads to more weapons, more vehicles, more ""Homies"" to call on when you need back-up, and more story missions. It's a heady feedback loop because, as Petit wrote, ""you're never held back from advancing through the story, or from doing just about anything else. ... With so many opportunities to earn respect, you're totally free to do only those activities you enjoy, and ignore the rest."" Every activity helps your long game in Saints Row: The Third, but importantly, you don't have to master every one.  It's not all a success, however. There are elements of the game that were seen as needlessly offensive in 2011 and those same things most certainly haven't aged well into 2019. Writing for Joystiq (which has since been folded into Engadget), Ben Gilbert raised the alarm on ""Whored Mode,"" a wave-based survival minigame that's separate from the main story mode. The premise is simple: you're dropped into a small arena and tasked with surviving an onslaught of attackers. The rules change from wave to wave — ""giant scantily clad women armed with swords ... and you've only got unlimited grenades,"" Gilbert offered as one example — and you're meant to survive as long as you can. The tastelessness of the mode's overarching concept, however, is a disappointment, per Joystiq's review. Here I was, violently murdering loads of women, often wearing bikinis (presumably ""whores?""), and for what reason exactly? The imagery made me personally uncomfortable. Thankfully, not every level/wave involves beating women with a purple dildo bat — the mode is meant to constrain your weapons to something specific (yes, occasionally the bat), and offer a challenge based on that. Sometimes I was facing off against multiple ""brutes"" (tank-like enemies equipped with miniguns or flamethrowers), sometimes it was furries, sometimes ""whores."" Again, it's a fun diversion if you can separate yourself from the frequently upsetting themes.  Thankfully, it's hard to imagine any developer seriously pitching a mode like this in 2019. But it's definitely an inescapable piece of the history here. The Switch edition of Saints Row: The Third is the 2011 game top to bottom, for better or worse. It ran great for me in portable and TV mode both, with the latter maybe enjoying a slight edge after I noticed some occasional slowdowns when the action got intense with the Switch in tablet mode. The bad stuff is still there. It's unfortunate to see Whored Mode on the main menu and completely unchanged. You don't have to engage with it at all — the story is entirely separate, and the main focus of this experience — but the menu option is still there looking back at you every time you load up the game.  I don't know if it's fair to expect or even ask for sensitivity-minded changes in an eight-years-later re-release. But the world has changed a lot since 2011 and people as a whole are generally more mindful of what they say and how they say it. And the existence of Whored Mode — as well as some of the more offensive humor in story mode — is something every potential buyer will have to reckon with and decide on for themselves. It's also worth mentioning that this Switch release contains every shred of add-on content introduced for Saints Row: The Third after it came out. There was some cool stuff in that collection, but you should also brace yourself: the first time you unlock your gang's clubhouse, prepare to spend multiple minutes cycling through ""These items have been added to your collection!"" pop-ups as all of those add-ons alert you to their existence, one after the other. That's a much smaller complaint than the sensitivity issues, of course. So long as you can set that aside, there's still a tremendous game to be enjoyed in Saints Row: The Third. Look for it on Switch starting May 10. "
585,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling edged lower against the dollar and euro on Monday, holding off 10-day highs hit last week, as traders awaited key wages data due later this week for clues to the pace of monetary tightening from the Bank of England. Markets have moved to price in an interest rate hike in May, but such tightening will hinge on pay growth picking up, and on whether Prime Minister Theresa May can soon secure a transition deal for the two years after Britain quits the European Union. The shift in market expectations followed a hawkish BoE meeting that said interest rates would need to rise sooner and by more than it had previously expected, in order to get inflation back on target within two years rather than three. But analysts say a flat labour market report on Wednesday could dampen those expectations. It would also be a source of concern for the BoE, which has predicted an acceleration of wage growth in 2018. “The Bank of England has hung its hat on the assumption that there will be wage inflation ... and that Brexit will be smooth. The signal they gave us that they are positioning for a May interest rate hike relies on this assumption,” Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley said. Investors have also become nervous about Brexit negotiations, after starting the year confident that Britain would secure a transitional deal. Sterling slumped earlier this month when the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said such a deal was “not a given”. Sterling was down 0.2 percent at $1.3998 GBP=D3 by 1707 GMT, just over 2 percent down from an 18-month high hit in late January. Against the euro it was down a similar amount to 88.59 pence per euro. Positioning data released on Friday showed speculators trimmed their bets on further sterling strength against the dollar for a third straight week, though they were still net-long the currency. [IMM/FX] “We must stress that (Brexit) negotiations are only just starting and one might bear in mind that trade negotiations are quite hard to settle,” wrote Didier Borowski, head of macroeconomic research at Amundi, in a note to clients. “Our base case scenario foresees an intermediate relationship (between Britain and the EU), with free trade in goods but only very partial passporting in financial services,” they added. “There is clearly scope for the pound to depreciate in this scenario.” Editing by Richard Balmforth, Larry King"
586,"U.S. government debt yields followed European rates lower Wednesday after new data suggested a gloomier economic outlook amid German business leaders. Bond yields around the world dipped after the Ifo Institute reported that confidence in German c-suites unexpectedly fell in April. The Munich-based researcher's business climate indicator fell for a seventh month in the last eight and contradicted upbeat forecasts with a 99.2 print. April's print was the indicator's lowest reading since 2016. The new data could point to persistent worries surrounding the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and slowing growth in general. ""The mood among German managers became slightly gloomier this month,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a press release Wednesday. ""March's gentle optimism regarding the coming months has evaporated. The German economy continues to lose steam."" At 10:36 a.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 2.52%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at 2.949%. The German 10-year bund traded at -0.014%. In the United States, the Treasury is set to sell $41 billion in 5-year notes and $20 billion in two-year floating rate notes. The Federal Reserve is one week away from its latest monetary policy decision on May 1, when it will decide whether to adjust the overnight lending rate. Oil prices dropped on Wednesday amid signs that supply is still adequate despite the U.S. announcing a push for tighter sanctions on Iran and a plan to halt waivers that had allowed limited Iranian oil imports."

590,"President Trump defended his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria on Twitter Monday, warning that he will ""totally destroy and obliterate"" Turkey's economy if the country does anything he considers ""off limits"" — presumably referring to a military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in the region. Why it matters: The president has faced intense backlash from Republicans who believe he has abandoned a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State. Turkey, however, is a member of NATO, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Sunday accepted an invitation from Trump to visit the White House next month. Flashback: In August 2018, Trump raised tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum after the lira slid dramatically amid a currency crisis, causing even more damage to the economy, per the Washington Post. He also slapped sanctions on Turkey over its detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson, causing a crisis in bilateral relations and further deterioration of the Turkish economy. Brunson was later released in October 2018 and allowed to return to the U.S. Go deeper: Turkey faces an economic crossroads after Istanbul elections"
591,"Google Maps is preparing to roll out a list-making feature that lets you star places, favorite places, and make bucket lists. That has led Foursquare to now respond by making its own lists feature more useful. The company announced this morning it’s introducing a new way to seek out lists on its app, through the launch of list search. This is a surprisingly late addition for the local discovery app, given how useful it is to be able to tap into the collective knowledge of the service’s users. But Foursquare’s strategy has always been somewhat mystifying, ever since the company decided to blow up its application and turn its business into two separate apps, a city guide and a social network. That move did not pan out well for its social app Swarm, which has continually fallen in the top charts, and now is lowly ranked in the 280’s in the Social Networking category on iTunes, and in the 330’s on Google Play. Nevertheless, Foursquare’s flagship app is still hanging in there, remaining a top 50 app in the Food & Drink category on both the App Store and Google Play. And with the launch of List Search, it could potentially become more useful. According to the company, you’ll now be able to search for the best lists in your area, created by brands and individuals alike. That could include lists with a narrow focus, like a one that details where to find the best tacos, for example, or those that offer broader insight into an area, like an insider’s guide to a neighborhood. The company is kicking off list search’s debut with a selection of lists from brands like Bon Appetit, PureWow, and others, including those it built in-house. This includes a state-by-state guide to America’s best pizza, a list of the best new restaurants in the U.S., and a list of the top 50 cocktail bars, to name a few. To access the new feature, you just tap on the list tab in the mobile application, then search for a keyword or brand."
592,"Working for a newspaper owned by a tech billionaire has its perks. Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos flew to Germany this week to rendezvous with journalist Jason Rezaian, who was recently freed after a 544-day imprisonment in an Iranian jail, and personally escort him home in his private jet, CNN's Brian Stelter first reported.  A Post spokesperson said the e-commerce mogul also had dinner with Rezaian and his family at the U.S. military base in Germany where the reporter was undergoing a series of medical tests and reuniting with loved ones.  Post Executive Editor Marty Baron and Foreign Editor Douglas Jehl also travelled to Germany to meet Rezaian after news broke last week that he would be freed in a prisoner swap brokered as part of the U.S.-Iran deal. Bezos previously gave Jehl a shoutout on Twitter.  Wheels up and out of Iranian airspace! Jason, Yegi, and Mary aboard.

Rezaian served as the Post's bureau chief in Tehran before he was imprisoned for espionage in the summer of 2014, then convicted last year in what was widely seen as a sham trial. Throughout the sentence, his family and coworkers at the Post campaigned the U.S. and Iranian government endlessly for his freedom. Bezos, who bought the Post in 2013, commended their efforts and celebrated Rezaian's release in a series of tweets last week.

594,"Fresh off a stunning 90-win campaign, Tampa Bay Rays manager Kevin Cash received a multi-year extension on Tuesday, the team announced. The extension runs through the 2024 campaign, according to the Tampa Bay Times. The Rays hold a club option for 2025. Cash guided the Rays to a 90-72 mark this season, his fourth with the club. He is 318-330 overall. “Obviously my family and I are thrilled and incredibly humbled,” Cash told the Tampa Bay Times. “I don’t know if surprised is the right word, or flattered that they were willing to give me that long of a deal. “This shows the long-term commitment from the Rays in wanting to see this through and continue to get the organization back to where it was in (playoff seasons) 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013.” Tampa Bay won 10 more games than 2017 as Cash went to an unorthodox way of using his pitching staff. Cash began using an “opener,” a reliever to pitch an inning or two to begin games, and the Rays finished third in the majors with a 3.50 ERA. Tampa Bay also has a leading candidate for the American League Cy Young Award in left-hander starter Blake Snell (21-5, 1.89). The Rays set club records for starting pitchers used (17), total pitchers (31), total players (54) and rookies (23). “We couldn’t be happier with the impact that Kevin has made on our organization, an impact that extends well beyond our major league club,” general manager Erik Neander said in a statement. “We’re thankful for this stability and the many advantages that it provides, especially the opportunity to continue learning and improving together.” —Field Level Media"
595,"A backlash, reminiscent of the fight over marriage licenses for same-sex couples in other states, takes root in New York. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] As he watched a live stream of a New York State Senate vote on Monday night, Michael P. Kearns, the county clerk in Erie County, sat in disbelief. For nearly two decades, efforts to allow undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses had failed. What he was seeing felt impossible: The State Legislature was passing the bill. “I was shocked,” said Mr. Kearns, who immediately took to Twitter to voice his dissent. “I knew I’d have to take stand against this.” With that vote, New York became the 13th state to grant driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants, an issue that has been entangled in a politically divisive, decades-long debate in the state. But the win for Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates is already being challenged. A growing coalition of county clerks say they will refuse to issue licenses, and they are threatening to take their fight to court. Only hours after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the bill, Mr. Kearns sent a letter to the Erie County attorney, Michael Siragusa, saying he planned to fight the law in federal court. They may be in a unique position to do so. Unlike in most states, where the Department of Motor Vehicles is administered by state agents, in New York these duties frequently fall on county clerks, many of whom are elected in conservative areas of upstate New York. The clerks said they believe the state’s new policy, known as the Green Light Law and that is scheduled to take effect in December, may conflict with federal immigration law, which prohibits employers from hiring immigrants they know are undocumented. “You are asking me to give a government document to somebody who is in our country breaking federal law. That is 100 percent wrong,’’ said Joseph A. Jastrzemski, the Niagara County clerk. “It compromises my oath of office to defend the Constitution.” The clerks also argue that the law’s implementation will strain their already overburdened motor vehicle offices and result in new costs, including hiring additional workers to handle the influx of applicants and training them to recognize the foreign paperwork required for an undocumented immigrant to obtain a license. Motor vehicle offices, the clerks said, are dealing with an already increased demand for appointments from drivers looking to obtain licenses that are compliant with the Real ID Act. That federal law requires licenses to meet new standards by October 2020 in order for American citizens to use them to fly domestically. “We are the busiest we have ever been; we are overwhelmed with customers coming in,” said Frank J. Merola, county clerk in Rensselaer County. The new law, he said, is “going to be a huge undertaking, actually an impossible undertaking” unless the state has the support of county clerks. Immigration advocates who fought for the bill’s passage argued that the revenue earned from offering the licenses would offset any costs associated with its initial rollout. The Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning research institute, estimated that the state would earn $57 million in annual revenue and $26 million in one-time revenue from driver’s licenses, new car purchases, registrations and sales and gas taxes. County clerks receive a percentage of the fees paid for each transaction at their motor vehicle office, but it remains unclear whether the state will offer additional financing as the new law is rolled out. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo declined to comment on Friday. More than 50 county clerks whose offices handle motor vehicle duties are planning a meeting on July 10 to discuss the issue, including possible litigation, Mr. Merola said. Letitia James, the state attorney general, has said she would defend the law if it were challenged in court. “The law is well crafted and contains ample protections for those who apply for driver’s licenses,” Ms. James said in a statement. Immigration advocacy groups have also said they are organizing legal teams to defend undocumented immigrants who are refused licenses. Steven Choi, the executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, compared New York county clerks who refuse to issue driver’s licenses to a county clerk in Kentucky, Kim Davis, who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples but ultimately lost in court. “We always knew there would be continued opposition to this, but these county clerks don’t have anything to stand on when it comes to their litigation,” Mr. Choi said. Jackie Vimo, a policy analyst at the National Immigration Law Center, a Washington-based group that defends low-income immigrants, said the backlash was indicative of New York’s unusual motor vehicle regulatory structure and the political divide between more liberal downstate communities and more conservative areas upstate. Even after Democrats seized complete control of the legislature last year, more moderate Democrats were concerned about the political fallout from the bill, which passed with just one more vote than the minimum needed. “You have a state that looks blue on the surface but ultimately geographically is quite red,” Ms. Vimo said. The issue of immigrants obtaining driver’s licenses has been a flash point in New York state since 2007, when former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, issued an executive order allowing undocumented immigrants to receive licenses. Mr. Spitzer faced fierce opposition from county clerks as well as conservative and liberal lawmakers across the country, including Kirsten Gillibrand, who was a United States representative from New York, and Hillary Clinton, who was a Senator representing New York. Mr. Spitzer rescinded the order two months later. The passage of the Green Light Law has propelled New York into the national spotlight on immigration and could help spur other states to pass similar legislation. State legislators in Oregon and New Jersey are considering similar proposals, and campaigns pushing for driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants have also begun in six other states. “We are seeing momentum growing right now, especially following New York where it has been such a long and hard fought struggle,” Ms. Vimo said. “This really changes political calculations and removes a lot of the excuses other states had not to pass similar legislation.”"
596,"* FTSE 100 up 1.1 pct * Oil stocks on the rise * IWG falls after profit warning (Adds closing prices, quotes) By Kit Rees and Julien Ponthus LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - The UK’s top share index rebounded on Wednesday as fresh optimism regarding U.S. trade policy fuelled risk appetite with the help of buoyant energy stocks. The blue chip FTSE 100 index started the day in negative territory but closed up 1.1 percent at 7,621.69 points. Tensions over trade between the U.S. and China have hit stock markets this week, with the FTSE sliding more than two percent on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to bar Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms. A subsequent U.S. decision to soften its tone and use strengthened security reviews rather than imposing China-specific restrictions was greeted with relief on Wall Street. “Firmly strapped into the trade war rollercoaster, the markets saw a chunky upswing on Wednesday afternoon as Trump appeared to pull back from the brink”, said Connor Campbell, a financial analyst for Spreadex. Energy stocks added the most points to the index as crude prices climbed on supply disruption in Canada and after U.S. officials told importers to stop buying Iranian crude from November. Miners also lift the FTSE 100 higher with Rio Tinto and BHP up 2 percent and 2.7 percent. Among individual stocks, shares in Carnival continued a recovery from a sell-off on Monday prompted by weak guidance in its results. The recovery was boosted by an upgrade from Berenberg to “buy” from “hold” and the stock ended the day up three percent. “We believe that the backdrop of strong consumer confidence continues to support the industry and, while we acknowledge the incoming supply, we do not see any evidence that supports the sell-off in the shares since the Q2 2018 numbers,” analysts at Berenberg said in a note. Carnival’s shares were up 1.8 percent. Shares in takeover target IWG, the British workspace firm, fell 2.8 percent after it warned on profit, blaming the cost of opening new space and a weak performance in Britain. Traders said the takeover interest from private equity firms Terra Firma and TDR Capital among others were supporting the stock despite the profit warning.

598,"A senior official of China's central bank told a briefing on Tuesday that the yuan's exchange rate is set by the market, rebutting President Donald Trump's claim a day earlier that the country was manipulating its currency. China is not manipulating the yuan, the official, Li Bo, is quoted as saying in a report in the South China Morning Post. He told reporters in Beijing that the country would not use its currency as a weapon in a trade war. ""We won't use policy to devalue the yuan and we won't use the exchange rate as a weapon to react to external pressures from trade conflicts,"" the report quotes Li as saying. Li, who did not name Trump directly, is director of monetary policy at the People's Bank of China. On Monday, Trump told reporters from Reuters in an interview that China was manipulating the yuan lower to make up for tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its goods. ""I think China's manipulating their currency, absolutely,"" he said. The yuan has fallen sharply against the dollar as the trade war between the two nations escalated this summer. Earlier this month, the dollar was trading at nearly 7 against the yuan, a level not seen in a decade. On Tuesday, the dollar/yuan trade was 6.86. The dollar has strengthened as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Trump has accused China of currency manipulation in the past. A weaker currency makes a country's goods more attractive to overseas buyers, so forcibly pushing it down would offset any effects from tariffs imposed by others. In an interview with CNBC in July, Trump said China's ""currency is dropping like a rock, and our currency is going up, and I have to tell you it puts us at a disadvantage."" A weakening currency also has a downside: capital flight out of the country, something China has been trying to stop. Chinese officials are expected to be in Washington later this week to renew trade talks with the U.S. as fresh U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods are supposed to kick in Thursday. China has pledged to retaliate. Read the South China Morning Post story here."
599,"The National Endowment for the Arts has announced its 2019 Jazz Masters, and it’s a diverse group. The honorees are the composer and bandleader Maria Schneider, the South African pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, the pianist and vocalist Bob Dorough and the critic Stanley Crouch. Last year, the Jazz Masters program appeared imperiled, as the Trump administration proposed eliminating the N.E.A. entirely. But the equilibrium has been restored, at least for now: The winners will each receive a $25,000 prize, as usual, and they will be celebrated according to custom in a ceremony at the Kennedy Center on April 15. Ms. Schneider, 57, is the youngest woman ever to be selected for the award, and the rare recipient who’s still in the prime of her career. Known for her ambitious compositions and dazzling orchestral work, Ms. Schneider, a Minnesota native, is a five-time Grammy Award winner and a perennial presence atop the DownBeat critics poll. Mr. Ibrahim is the first African-born musician to be chosen for the award; he moved to the United States in the 1960s, eventually becoming an American citizen. Since then, he has drawn from the musical mélange of his hometown, Cape Town; the influence of earlier pianists like Thelonious Monk and Duke Ellington; and the avant-garde innovations that greeted him when he first arrived in New York City. Mr. Dorough, whose career in jazz spanned more than 60 years, will become the rare posthumous recipient of the award. He was best known for the music to “Schoolhouse Rock,” but his compositions also appeared on recordings by the likes of Miles Davis and Blossom Dearie. Mr. Dorough was notified earlier this year that he had been selected to receive the award, but he died soon after. (Jazz Masters must be living at the time of their nomination.) Mr. Crouch, 72, is this year’s recipient of the A. B. Spellman N.E.A. Jazz Masters Fellowship for Jazz Advocacy. He began his career as an avant-garde drummer and poet before embracing a neoclassical ideology and establishing himself as one of the most provocative and influential writers on jazz. A friend and mentor of Wynton Marsalis, he played a central role in the founding of Jazz at Lincoln Center in the late 1980s. Mr. Crouch’s books include the essay collection “Considering Genius,” the novel “Don’t the Moon Look Lonesome?” and “Kansas City Lightning: The Rise and Times of Charlie Parker.”"

603,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 touched a record high on Tuesday and equaled its longest-ever bull-market run, buoyed by strong earnings reports in the consumer sector and relative calm in the trade dispute between the United States and China.  The S&P 500 .SPX rose as much as 0.6 percent to a record intraday high of 2,873.23 points, topping its previous record high of 2,872.87 on Jan. 26, though it closed below both those marks.  Late in the day, stock market futures fell after U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other charges, saying he made payments to influence the 2016 election at the direction of a candidate for federal office.  “The stock market loves the Trump agenda. Anything that’s damaging to Donald Trump’s agenda is not going to be good for the stock market,” said Stephen Massoca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  The index’s bull-market run is now 3,452 days old and on Wednesday would become the longest such streak in history, at least for some market watchers.  Trade-sensitive industrial stocks rose for the fourth consecutive session as investors remained optimistic the United States and China could move closer to settling their trade dispute. The S&P 500 industrial index .SPLRCI rose 0.8 percent.  The S&P consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD climbed 0.9 percent as shares of off-price retailer TJX Companies Inc (TJX.N) rose on strong results and Toll Brothers Inc’s (TOL.N) encouraging quarterly report boosted shares of homebuilders.  “We’ve got good momentum, which is fundamentally justified by the strong economy and better earnings,” said Kevin Caron, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. “Investors still seem relatively optimistic about growth, and you’re seeing that expressed in the market today.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 63.6 points, or 0.25 percent, to 25,822.29, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 5.91 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,862.96 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 38.17 points, or 0.49 percent, to 7,859.17.  The small-cap Russell 2000 index , which is less affected by global tariff disputes than its large-cap peers, ended the session up 1.1 percent at a record closing high.  The S&P 500 energy index .SPNY rose 0.5 percent and the S&P 500 materials index .SPLRCM gained 0.4 percent, in tandem with higher prices for oil and metals.  Helping commodity prices was a drop in the dollar after Trump said he was “not thrilled” with the Federal Reserve for raising rates and that the central bank should do more to help him boost the economy.  The criticism came ahead of the release of the Fed’s minutes of its August policy meeting on Wednesday, which is expected to reaffirm its confidence in the U.S. economy and its commitment to future rate hikes.  Toll Brothers shares jumped 13.8 percent after the homebuilder reported better-than-expected quarterly results. Shares of its industry peers PulteGroup (PHM.N), Lennar (LEN.N) and D.R. Horton (DHI.N) also rose between 3.8 percent and 5.5 percent.  TJX shares climbed 4.7 percent, ending the session at a record closing high, after the retailer topped quarterly comparable-store sales estimates and raised its full-year earnings forecast.  But shares of Coty Inc (COTY.N) tumbled 7.1 percent after the beauty products maker missed sales estimates for the first time in six quarters.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.88-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.32-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 164 new highs and 32 new lows.  Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.86 billion shares, compared with the 6.49 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

604,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s Angela Merkel called for a spirit of compromise on reforming the euro zone at a meeting on Thursday with French President Emmanuel Macron, who pressed for solidarity among members of the currency union. Before their talks, the two said they would present a united front at June meeting of European Union leaders on a range of issues including reform of the 19-member euro zone, which Merkel said they agreed was “not yet sufficiently crisis-proof”. France and Germany, which account for around 50 percent of euro zone output, are essential to the reform drive. Stressing the need for compromise, Merkel said: “We each bring some different facets but I think the sum of our proposals will make for a good result in the end.” However, their meeting took place against a backdrop of grumbling by lawmakers from Merkel’s conservative bloc, wary that Macron’s call for more solidarity could see German taxpayers’ money used to fund profligate member states. “No monetary union can exist without elements of convergence,” the French leader told a news conference with Merkel in the German capital before their talks. “The most important thing is not to react on such and such instrument at this stage, but to be sure that we share the same goals and to have a joint political objective,” he added. At pains to present a united front despite their underlying differences and distinct styles - Merkel’s cautious, no-nonsense approach contrasts with Macron’s bold rhetoric - they stressed they would tackle a range of issues, including migrant policy. Macron reiterated a proposal made at the European parliament to subsidize local authorities who welcomed refugees. “We can’t let this or that country alone carry the burden of hosting and integrating (migrants),” he said. On a European asylum system, Merkel said the two leaders agreed on many points, and concurred that offering incentives was a better approach than talking about penalties. Macron’s vision also includes turning Europe’s existing bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), to act as a buffer in any future financial crises in the bloc, which was nearly torn apart in a debt crisis that took hold in 2009. He has also suggested the euro zone have its own finance minister and, at one point, floated the idea of a budget for the currency bloc worth hundreds of billions of euros. Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD), Merkel’s junior coalition partner, sympathize with Macron’s call for solidarity. They want him to be rewarded for efforts to reform the French economy, well aware that a big chunk of French voters remain susceptible to far-right and far-left populists skeptical about the EU. But Merkel’s larger conservative bloc insists on what they call the principle of ‘liability’, whereby individual member states carry responsibility for their own economic risks. Merkel said she was very optimistic about completing a banking union. Berlin’s focus has long been on banks first reducing the risks they take in lending. “We are also ready, perhaps not in the immediate future but in the longer term, to agree on a common deposit guarantee system,” said Merkel. “But we want liability and risks to be kept together.” Underlining a sense of urgency for reform in Brussels, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici warned momentum could be lost for deepening euro zone integration if decisions are not taken at the June summit. “We are some way from reaching a consensus on the priorities and method for moving the euro area forward and time is running out,” Moscovici said in a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

605,"At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, one of the big topics of conversation was education. Despite billions poured into programmes in developing countries to educate booming populations, the budgets are just scratching the surface. UNESCO estimates that the world would have to increase education development spending to $39 billion a year, or about three times current levels, if it was to have any real effect. Given that this funding is unlikely to arrive any time soon – and given President Trump’s drastic cutting of funding to UN projects – others are looking in to how technology can play a role. This is exactly what new startup Matterfund plans to tackle. The SF/London-based non-profit has taken a leaf out of the Crunchbase and AngelList playbook, to, as it says, “turn on the lights” for those working in education development. The idea is to surface all the programmes out there, and this make the whole thing more transparent and efficient. This is a non-profit intelligence platform and social graph seeking to match top education initiatives to funders, partners and system leaders. Nathan Martin, Matterfund’s ED of Strategy says “many insights are locked away in 100 page PDFs. We want to democratise education intelligence, break insights out into a real-time Crunchbase-like platform, so people and funders have a better sense of their surroundings.” In the last six months, they built and piloted their platform in South Africa, enrolling 132 organizations, including 15 funders representing $149M in educations funds, and are being supported and nurtured by the WEF’s Global Agenda Council on Education. They are already getting interest. Melanie Smuts, CEO and Founder of Streetlight Schools, a Johannesburg-based school serving underserved communities says Matterfund’s platform will “make it much easier to find and connect with organisations who could help support for our work. Matterfund would let me spend less time on fundraising and more time in our classrooms.” This past July, the Council partnered with innovation agency Entangled Solutions to put together the Matterfund team and validate the pilot. “We are focused on quality product,” said Kyle Cureau, Matterfund’s interim CEO. “We started with 150 hours of field interviews and we continue to shape our development around the need of our users.” Matterfund was initially funded by Dino Varkey, head of GEMS Education, and an ally of the Clinton Foundation. Pearson Education provided strong support and additional funding. Sir Michael Barber of Pearson serving as chair of the Global Agenda Council and seconding Martin to the project. Members of the steering group (including Joel Klein (Oscar Health), J Puckett (BCG) and Shiv Khemka (The Global Education and Leadership Foundation) donated time and personal funding to the project. They are now expanding Matterfund’s intelligence tools to the Middle East, India, and Pakistan and have $130M in total funding represented and over 1,300 profiles across 19 impact topics. It’s fascinating to see that Crunchbase/AngelList could inspire such a project..."
606,"After looking at the best of the year, Insider revisits the movies we had high hopes for in 2019 that let us down.A lot of fans were bummed by a lukewarm conclusion to the ""Unbreakable"" trilogy. Despite Sony getting two bankable stars in Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth, the ""Men in Black"" revival fell flat.Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.2019 gave us some really good movies, but it also brought a lot of remakes, sequels, and adaptations people weren't interested in seeing. Insider rounded up the movies audiences were looking forward to this year that missed the mark. We're not talking about the worst movies of 2019. This list looks at the films that we had high expectations for that didn't live up to the hype and underwhelmed at the box office.  If there's any lesson that can be learned from this year, it's that Hollywood needs to focus on originality. From failed attempts at reviving long gone franchises to big actors starring in complete misfires no one asked for, here's what disappointed us the most at theaters.







 



""The Curse of La Llorona"" was not as scary as fans hoped.










Despite being a box-office hit, the horror film was not well-received by critics or audiences. Filled with hit-jump scares and moments that delivered chuckles instead of frights, more was expected from a film that was based on the terrifying Mexican legend about a woman drowning her children. No one's going to want to watch this film again.





""Terminator: Dark Fate"" was a huge box-office misfire.










""Terminator: Dark Fate"" was the best movie in the franchise since ""Terminator 2."" It even reunited original stars Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was everything fans could have wanted from a ""Terminator"" movie with good reviews, so it's a shame more didn't come out to see it. ""Dark Fate"" makes our list because it was one of the biggest box-office letdowns of the year and should've kicked off a new franchise. Instead, the R-rated ""Dark Fate"" only brought in $29 million opening weekend and could lose well over $100 million for Paramount, Skydance Media, and Fox (now Disney), which handled international distribution for the film. What went wrong? What may have upset fans is that the sixth movie scrapped the last three films from canon. The past three times audiences have shown up for ""Terminator"" films, they frankly haven't been very good. (Remember the last film, ""Genisys""?) Even with original director James Cameron back as a producer, that may not have been enough of a nostalgia sell in order for fans to take a risk on going to theaters. The failure of ""Dark Fate"" may be the end of the franchise on the big screen moving forward. You can read our review of ""Dark Fate"" here. 



 



""Doctor Sleep"" showed that not every Stephen King novel needs to be adapted.










""It"" worked for Warner Bros., so why not try and bring back another Stephen King classic for audiences to relive all over again? ""Doctor Sleep"" is a strange mix between book adaptation and ""The Shining"" sequel. It tried delivering too much in an attempt to pay homage to the book and Stanley Kubrick's film while also trying to set itself apart with a third act that throws the source material out the window.We're fine with giving us a new ending. I thought Paramount's ""Pet Sematary"" did a clever job at remixing its source material earlier this year. But Warner Bros.' adaptation leaned too heavily on simply regurgitating a lot of Kubrick's film toward the end to give us something we've already seen before. The film also gave us an unnecessary Jack Nicholson look-alike that felt too weird. We're not sure anyone needed Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) doing an impression of Nicholson's iconic ax chase, either.Audiences agreed as the film bombed opening weekend. According to Deadline, the film is set to lose Warner Bros. $20 million.You can read our review here. 





""The Kitchen"" was the worst box-office opening for both Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish.










It's tough to believe these three women Kathy (Melissa McCarthy), Ruby (Tiffany Haddish), and Claire (Elisabeth Moss) — two who are squeamish at the sight of blood — are able to take over the Irish mob after their husbands are put away in jail for a robbery.The transitions of all three women into slightly reckless killers feels unearned and a bit empty in a convoluted plot. Haddish and McCarthy in particular don't sell that they're two mob wives and, in a confusing turn, Moss' character almost instantly transforms from a timid, abused woman into a hardened killing machine without little development.""The Kitchen"" often feels like you're watching a parody of a gangster movie. Despite the star power, the film bombed, becoming the worst opening weekend at the box office for McCarthy and Haddish. According to The Hollywood Reporter, it could lose ""tens of millions"" for Warner Bros.



 



""Serenity"" was a waste of star talent you may have missed all together.










Trailers looked like ""Serenity"" could've been a promising thriller with Academy Award winners Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. But when the reviews came out, it was trashed by critics as a disaster.The first sign that ""Serenity"" wasn't going to work should've been its January release date. The film was pushed back twice from an original awards season run to a time that's notoriously known as a dump month for movies. Aviron Pictures must have known what they had on their hands because they stopped promoting the film after failed test screenings with press and viewers. The movie opened to the worst-ever box-office opening for Hathaway with $4.5 million. 





Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler's reunion in ""Murder Mystery"" was painful to watch.










Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler reteaming for a movie for the first time since 2011's ""Just Go With It"" sounded like a fantastic idea, but ""Murder Mystery"" is pretty unwatchable.The two star as a couple who go on a long overdue honeymoon. Unfortunately, they wind up on a yacht caught up in a murder mystery. Like many other Sandler films, this one is filled with low-brow humor. Although Aniston and Sandler look like they're having fun, they're the only ones as the film drags along for a dull 90 minutes.Apparently, it doesn't matter how bad the film was reviewed. Nearly 31 million Netflix accounts tuned into the film the weekend it debuted and it was enough for the streaming service to warrant a sequel.



 



""Hellboy"" proved that you just can't stick a popular star into any old remake.










Did anybody ask for a ""Hellboy"" remake? Once Guillermo del Toro, who directed the first two movies, wasn't attached to the franchise, there was little interest in why fans should get invested in a reboot when the first two were well-liked among fans. Even with the popular David Harbour (""Stranger Things"") taking over the role, the re-imagining was a huge misfire. Despite a passionate performance from Harbour, this remake was forgettable. Critics reamed the film for being flat out awful, dragging on and overcomplicating a simple story, and having an overabundance of CGI.  





""The Goldfinch"" didn't translate to the big screen.










Many were excited for the adaptation of Donna Tarrt's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel because of its stacked cast (Nicole Kidman, Jeffrey Wright, and Ansel Elgort) along with Oscar-nominated director John Crowley, but it was another big miss.Insider's Kim Renfro said the movie's non-linear storytelling robs the story of cohesion and make its emotional punches fall by the wayside. The movie also feels laboriously long while failing to properly develop its characters .Most curiously, the film fails to answer every question it presents even though they're resolved in the book. Unless you're familiar with the novel, you may be confused with the film's conclusion.""The Goldfinch"" opened to $2.5 million opening weekend, the sixth-worst opening of all time for a release that large. On a reported $45 million budget before marketing, the film has only grossed $9.7 million worldwide.You can read Renfro's analysis of ""The Goldfinch"" here.



 



""Glass"" didn't deliver the film people were expecting.










I liked ""Glass"" a lot more than others. But I'm aware that it's not what people expected going into the movie.M. Night Shyamalan surprised audiences when it was revealed 2016's ""Split"" was a secret sequel to 2000's ""Unbreakable."" Expectations were extremely high that fans would get a big showdown from this year's ""Glass"" between Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, and James McAvoy's characters.That wasn't the case. Instead, the three spent much of their time locked up in a psychiatric hospital throughout the film delivering what may have felt like to many as a bait and switch.You can read our review here.





""Gemini Man"" looks gorgeous, but the story was awful.










""Gemini Man"" looked like it was going to be something really special. Not only was Will Smith playing dual roles as his young and old self, but director Ang Lee (""Life of Pi"") shot the movie at 120 frames per second (fps) for a film that should have been an in-theater experience unlike any other.Unfortunately, the film has two things working against it. The first is that no theater has the technical capabilities of screening the film the way Lee intended the film to be seen on a 4K projector at 120 fps and in 3D. The second is that the story was too dull to match the sharp visuals on screen. The film failed to pick up steam stateside or in China and faces a $75 million loss. You can read Business Insider's review here. 



 



""Men in Black International"" should've been the start of a new franchise.










Sony didn't have Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones back for another time around, but that shouldn't have mattered. The studio had built-in anticipation for the film by having Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson working together.These were two people fans wanted to see together after Marvel's hilarious ""Thor: Ragnarok"" had the two team up. All Sony needed to do was deliver a film with a decent story. It was too bad that this ""MIB"" requel (a franchise reboot staged as a sequel) didn't live up to the hype. Thompson and Hemsworth do what they can with a predictable, uninspired script, but it looks like there was more effort put into making sure the gadgets and tech looked sleek than delivering an interesting enough story to match.More time is spent telling Hemsworth's Agent H throughout the film that he seems different (but no one can put their finger on exactly what has changed about him) than fully explaining the film's mystery villains. The addition of a tiny alien sidekick, voiced by Kumail Nanijiani (""Stuber""), weighed this one down as it seemed like nothing more than a corporate mandate to appeal to kids. Even Sony's studio boss, Tom Rothman, told sister site Business Insider there probably ""was not a strong enough idea in the story."" Audiences were probably quick to recognize that and as word of mouth spread, decided to wait for the film's home release instead. The fourth film had the worst opening in the franchise's history and grossed less worldwide than any of the three films before it. 





The X-Men went out with a dud in ""Dark Phoenix.""










Fox's final big ""X-Men"" movie wasn't the worst in the franchise, but it left a lot to be desired as the film revisited the Jean Grey phoenix story line that was previously brought to screen in 2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" The movie mainly suffered because of poorly fleshed-out villains and a completely reshot ending. Viewers probably would've gotten better versions of both if it wasn't for another movie. In an interview, James McAvoy told Yahoo Movies UK the movie's entire ending was changed in order to avoid similarities to another unnamed superhero movie. According to another interview with Tye Sheridan, the film's vague alien villains were supposed to be shape-shifters named Skrulls. If that name sounds familiar it's because those are the aliens who appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and who were a big part of Disney's ""Captain Marvel."" It's worth noting Disney acquired 20th Century Fox ahead of the film's release and was in charge of its final marketing and theatrical release. The movie had the lowest box-office gross worldwide of any ""X-Men"" film with $252 million worldwide and is set to lose over $100 million.It's unfortunate because this is possibly the last outing with some of these actors before Disney eventually reboots the property into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The ""X-Men"" really helped define and influence the direction of popular superhero movies today.You can read our review of ""X-Men: Dark Phoenix"" here.

607,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service has agreed to pay $24 million to settle a 17-year-old federal lawsuit filed by a group of black agents who accused the agency of racial discrimination in its employment practices. The agreement settles a protracted legal battle that began in 2000 when 10 black agents filed a lawsuit in a Washington D.C. federal court, claiming the Secret Service had violated the civil rights of black agents for decades while ignoring their complaints, court records showed. “Had the matter gone to trial, it would have required that we re-live things long past, just at a time when the Secret Service is on the mend,” Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said in a statement. “This settlement is also, simply, the right thing to do.” The 10 agents accused the Secret Service of racial discrimination in how it selected agents for promotions. They also claimed the agency conducted unfair hiring, assignment and transfer practices while fostering a racially hostile workplace, court documents showed. A group of more than 100 agents joined the lawsuit over time, the Washington Post reported. Under the resolution, the Secret Service could pay as much as $300,000 each to the agents who originally sued the agency. “At long last . . . black Secret Service agents will not be constrained by the glass ceiling that held back so many for so long,” Jennifer Klar, a lawyer for the agents, told the newspaper. The Secret Service admitted no wrongdoing, but agreed to reform its employment and promotion practices, the complaint process for employees and how it keeps records, the agreement said. The agency, charged with protecting the president and his family, has dealt with a lengthy list of problems during the past few years, including a prostitution scandal in Colombia and a high-profile security lapse when a man jumped the fence surrounding the White House complex and ran into the mansion armed with a knife.

608,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A transition period offered to Britain by the European Union in Brexit negotiating guidelines it issued on Friday is the only way to avoid the talks failing, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. In the guidelines, the EU offered Britain talks this year on a future free trade pact but made clear that London must first agree to the bloc’s demands on the terms of Brexit. The document, seen by Reuters, sets tough conditions for any transition period, insisting Britain must accept many EU rules after any such partial withdrawal. Detlef Seif, the deputy EU spokesman for Merkel’s conservative parliamentary bloc, said there were effectively only 15 months for the negotiations and this was insufficient time to wrap up Britain’s exit from the bloc. “Without transitional provisions, the negotiations would be doomed to failure from the start,” Seif told Reuters. “The proposal provides the necessary room and flexibility to negotiate reasonably and to reach high-quality arrangements,” he said of the guidelines, which may be revised before leaders of the remaining 27 EU states endorse them at an April 29 summit. “The more access to the internal market Britain wants, the greater the trade-off and so the more Britain must submit to EU law,” said Seif, warning Britain not to try to divide the bloc by negotiating with individual member states. “Should this transpire, it would be the end of the EU’s good behavior and willingness to compromise, which can clearly be seen in the draft guidelines,” he added. Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s spokesman, told reporters on Friday that negotiations about a future free trade deal between Britain and the EU could take place only after the contours of the Brexit divorce talks were clear. Bavarian premier Horst Seehofer said it was important to quickly establish new parameters for trade with Britain, his state’s third biggest European trading partner. “We must establish a new basis for the relationship in the Brexit negotiations as quickly as possible, and do everything we can to avoid new trade barriers,” he wrote in a commentary to be published next week in German magazine vbw-Unternehmermagazin.

609,"BENGALURU/OSLO (Reuters) - Travel website Kayak is making changes to let customers exclude specific aircraft types from searches, and booking sites are looking to reroute passengers, after an unexplained Boeing jet crash that killed 157 people in Ethiopia.  The first move by one of the big U.S. travel websites to adapt its service came as hundreds of jittery customers of Southwest, United and American Airlines took to social media to seek flights on planes other than the Boeing 737 MAX, which was involved in the fatal crash on Sunday.  Other travel agents and websites reported a raft of re-bookings as a result of cancellations caused by the grounding of two-thirds of 737 MAX jets by a long list of global authorities and airlines outside North America.  “We’ve recently received feedback to make Kayak’s filters more granular in order to exclude particular aircraft models from search queries,” a spokeswoman for the website told Reuters in an email responding to questions.  “We are releasing that enhancement this week and are committed to providing our customers with all the information they need to travel with confidence.”  Kayak is a sister site of Booking.com and Agoda.com, used by millions of travelers each year to book flights and hotels.  Carlson Wagonlit Travel, which manages travel for big global businesses, said some clients had asked to explore the possibility of temporarily restricting travel on Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes.  “This could potentially result in travelers being left with fewer flight options and susceptible to higher airfares, depending on the route,” CWT said. “We are working with clients to understand the practicality and the implications of putting such restrictions in place.”  The Twitter accounts of Southwest and American Airlines were swamped with customers asking for refunds or to be moved to other flights, and complaints about long hold times before being connected to a representative.  Twitter user @johnpauli6 wrote to Southwest that he does not want to be on a Boeing 737 MAX 8 when he travels with his wife on Saturday. “Get ready for a lot of lawsuits” if anything happens, the user said.  American Airlines Group Inc said late on Wednesday it was working to re-book customers due to fly on the 737 MAX as quickly as possible after the United States banned the aircraft.  Southwest, the world’s largest operator of the 737 MAX 8 with 34 jets, said it is waiving any fare-difference charges for customers who wish to switch to another aircraft following bans across much of the world.  Boeing has been mentioned more than 590,000 times on Twitter, a 2,300 percent increase from median daily mentions figures.  The crash in Ethiopia was the second in the last five months involving a Boeing 737 MAX 8. Last year, a Lion Air jet went down in Indonesia, killing 189 people.  Though there is no proof of links, multiple nations and the European Union have suspended the 737 MAX.  Boeing has said it has no reason to doubt the airplane, and Southwest and American have both said their fleet data showed the plane was safe.  “While the situation has not stopped people traveling on business, many want to know what plane they’ll be flying on,” said a spokesman for American Express Global Business Travel, another major corporate provider.  “When a traveler books a trip, we know at that moment what aircraft type is assigned to service the flight. However, that can change at an airline’s discretion up until the time of departure.”  Temporary bouts of nerves among travelers are a familiar part of the reaction to major crashes, and agents booking travel for major executives have remained cautious about making changes to booking systems in response to the Boeing row.  Norwegian travel agent Berg-Hansen, dealing with cancellations of flights on Norwegian Air’s 737 MAX planes, said clients were mainly concerned with whether their flights were still scheduled to fly and the need to re-book if so.  “We have increased our staff from last night, through the night and now,” Berg-Hansen Chief Executive Officer Per-Arne Villadsen said.  “Remarkably we have less phone calls than we expected, although they are more than usual. We had around 100 phone calls from midnight to 7 a.m. this morning and they keep coming.”  He said the company was using alternative airlines including SAS, AirFrance and KLM to re-book and that he believed customers would come back to Norwegian Air if they reopened flights on the MAX in the future.  “We can confirm a rising interest on the aircraft types we are operating,” a spokesman for Swedish-based SAS said. “I can guarantee you that we have not even considered changing any pricing policy due to the tragic situation.”  Additional reporting by Angela Moon in New York and Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore; editing by Patrick Graham and Sai Sachin Ravikumar"

612,"(Adds housing data, analyst comments, updates markets) * Weekly jobless claims unchanged at 227,000 * Four-week average of claims rises 3,500 to 221,000 * Mid-Atlantic factory activity picks up in November * Existing home sales increase 1.9% in October WASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits was unexpectedly unchanged at a five-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labor market. While other data on Thursday showed a mild pick-up in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region this month, manufacturers reported a sharp slowdown in new orders, shipments and unfilled orders. There were also declines in factory employment and hours measures. The persistent weakness in manufacturing is despite an easing in tensions in the 16-month trade war between the United States and China, which has depressed capital expenditure. The reports added to last week's downbeat October retail sales and manufacturing output data in suggesting the economy lost speed in the fourth quarter. Slower growth was underscored by the third straight monthly decline in a gauge of future economic activity in October. But the risks of a recession in the near term are low as the housing market is rebounding from last year's soft patch, driven by lower mortgage rates. The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. ""This is no time for complacency, but it's not time to panic either,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were flat at a seasonally adjusted 227,000 for the week ended Nov. 16, the highest level since June 22, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more claims received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims decreasing to 219,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,500 to 221,000 last week, the highest since June 29. The claims data covered the week that the government surveyed establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report. The four-week average of claims rose 5,250 between the October and November survey weeks. While that would suggest little change in job gains this month, employment growth will be boosted by the return to payrolls of about 46,000 workers at General Motors. The 40-day strike at the automaker's plants in Michigan and Kentucky helped to hold back payrolls gains to 128,000 jobs in October. ""This recent weakening in the claims data points to some deterioration in the labor market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""We expect effects of the recent United Automobile Workers strike to boost the November employment count after depressing the October data."" The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as a row between Washington and Beijing over protests in Hong Kong cast doubts on the timing of a trade deal. WORKER SHORTAGES Job growth has slowed this year, averaging 167,000 per month compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018, in part because of the U.S.-China trade spat, ebbing demand and a shortage of workers. Minutes of the Fed's Oct. 29-30 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed that while officials at the U.S. central bank viewed labor market conditions as remaining strong, they also acknowledged the slowdown in the pace of job gains. Policymakers attributed the moderation in hiring to worker shortages and also viewed it as ""indicative of some cooling in labor demand,"" in line with recent declines in job vacancies. Troubles for manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy, have persisted into the fourth quarter. In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index rose to 10.4 in November from 5.6 in October. But the survey's measures of new orders, employment and shipments declined, pointing to underlying weakness in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. The Philadelphia Fed survey's six-month business conditions index rose to 35.8 this month from 33.8 in October. But its six-month capital expenditures index tumbled to 19.4 from a reading of 36.4 in the prior month A survey from the New York Fed last Friday showed a drop in its business conditions index this month and manufacturers remained pessimistic about conditions over the next six months. Manufacturing is also being undercut by an inventory overhang, especially in the automobile sector, design problems at Boeing and slowing global growth. The Fed minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers believed conditions for manufacturing ""were unlikely to improve materially over the near term,"" citing ""continuing concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty."" In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million units in October. But gains are likely to be limited. The median existing house price surged 6.2% from a year ago to 270,900 in October, the biggest rise since June 2017. In addition, the stock of houses on the market fell. ""This is likely to be as good as it gets for existing home sales,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Baby boomers are sitting on their properties and not downsizing or moving as much as earlier generations and this is likely to put the kibosh on any further improvement in existing home sales for this cycle."" A fourth report from the Conference Board showed its Leading Economic Index dipped 0.1% in October after declining 0.2% in both September and August.

613,"Following is a transcript of the main Republican presidential debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service. NEIL CAVUTO: It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina. Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network.I’m Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo. MARIA BARTIROMO: Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered. And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race. That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide. CAVUTO: Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight. And here they are. Businessman Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) Texas senator Ted Cruz. (APPLAUSE) Florida senator Marco Rubio. (APPLAUSE) Neurosurgeon Ben Carson. (APPLAUSE) New Jersey governor Chris Christie. (APPLAUSE) Former Florida governor Jeb Bush. And Ohio governor John Kasich. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Tonight’s rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you’ll hear this. (BELL RINGS) So let’s get started. Candidates, jobs and growth — two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, “we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.” And according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half. The president said that anyone who claims America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn’t? CRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us. Let me start — I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads. In that State of the Union, President Obama didn’t so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obama’s preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I’ll tell you, it was heartbreaking. But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. (APPLAUSE) And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) Now, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, he’s right. If you’re a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country. The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C. BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable. Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency? KASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I’ve done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It’s the same thing that I did in Ohio. It’s a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts — if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you’re going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the — in the world. But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when you’re in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest. Right now, you don’t have the — you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations — I mean, come on, they’re affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are — they’re in a position where they’re smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? We’re nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline. Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I’ve done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And I’ve done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive. Our wages are growing faster than the national average. We’re running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried — Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger. Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order? CHRISTIE: Well, Maria, I’m glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what’s going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I’ve got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know? (APPLAUSE) The fact is, there’s a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word. Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they’ve never said about me is that I’m misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we’re going to keep it. Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he’s absolutely right. It’s a — it’s absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what’s going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better. The president doesn’t understand — and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton — and here’s my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If you’re worried about the world being on fire, you’re worried about how we’re going to use our military, you’re worried about strengthening our military and you’re worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama’s leadership. I will not do that. If I’m the nominee, she won’t get within 10 miles of the White House. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action? CHRISTIE: MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the world’s policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready. And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it’s just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say? BUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow we’re better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder. Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. He’s missing the whole point, that America’s leadership in the world is required for peace and stability. In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who’s the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient. (APPLAUSE) I’ve learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can’t even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we’re in a much difficult — we’re in a much different position than we should be. And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back. As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world’s policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president. BUSH: No. And worse — worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster. Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have — that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong. And you know what? Here’s the problem. If she gets elected, she’s under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn’t threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages. But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now? RUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn’t just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States. (APPLAUSE) Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever. (APPLAUSE) On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And that’s how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America. He doesn’t understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win. When I’m president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator. BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders? CARSON: Well, I’m very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came. (LAUGHTER) You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president’s proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesn’t realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid. I mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us. But here’s the real key. We have the world’s best military, even though he’s done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don’t tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he’s now trying to start a new life. The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that? TRUMP: It’s not fear and terror, it’s reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over. (APPLAUSE) You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there’s a — the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They’re very, very badly wounded. They will — some will follow. And you look around, and you see what’s happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor — very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration. That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they’re saying what’s going on? You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized — they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 — going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look — a good strong look and that’s what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars — our country’s a mess and we can’t let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can’t do it. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, “it was inadvertent.” A million dollars is inadvertent? CRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don’t hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, “Anybody But Cruz.” Had that actually — that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, “It Follows” that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people. So you know the New York Times and I don’t have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate — unlike Hillary Clinton, I don’t have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned. We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack — is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that’s the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well. BARTIROMO: Thank you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Let’s get right back to the questions. And I’ll start with you, Senator Cruz. Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist — no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if you’ve heard this before. Now, you were born... (LAUGHTER) ... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump — and others — have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility. Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight? CRUZ: Well, Neil, I’m glad we’re focusing on the important topics of the evening. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue. (LAUGHTER) Now, since September, the Constitution hasn’t changed. (LAUGHTER) But the poll numbers have. (APPLAUSE) And I recognize — I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen. If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That’s why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president. If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That’s why George Romney, Mitt’s dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico. At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on — some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil. Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified. (APPLAUSE) (UNKNOWN): Not me. CRUZ: Because — because Donald’s mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald... TRUMP: But I was born here. CRUZ: ... on the issue — on the issue of citizenship, Donald... TRUMP: (inaudible). Big difference. CRUZ: ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I’m not going to use your mother’s birth against you. TRUMP: OK, good. Because it wouldn’t work. CRUZ: You’re an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who’s best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that’s the most important question facing the country. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Mr. Trump... (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: ... that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers. TRUMP: ... first of all, let me just tell you something — and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself — NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll — headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so don’t — so you can’t — you can’t... (BOOING) ... they don’t like the Wall Street Journal. They don’t like NBC, but I like the poll. (LAUGHTER) And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I’m beating you. So — you know, you shouldn’t misrepresent how well you’re doing with the polls. (APPLAUSE) You don’t have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that’s a misrepresentation, number one. Number two, this isn’t me saying it. I don’t care. I think I’m going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way. Thank you. Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard — of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office. Here’s the problem. We’re running. We’re running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can’t take him along for the ride. I don’t like that. OK? (LAUGHTER) The fact is — and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible). See, they don’t like that. They don’t like that. (AUDIENCE BOOING) No, they don’t like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me. (LAUGHTER) But — if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you’re running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldn’t have mentioned the polls because I would have been much... (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: Why are you saying this now — right now? Why are you raising this issue now? TRUMP: Because now he’s going a little bit better. No, I didn’t care (inaudible). It’s true. No, it’s true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, he’s doing better. He’s got probably a four or five percent chance. (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) CRUZ: Neil... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. There’s a big question mark on your head. And you can’t do that to the party. You really can’t. You can’t do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and it’s far greater than one percent because (inaudible). I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can’t run. If there was a — and you know I’m not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You can’t have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you can’t have a question over your head. CAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond? CRUZ: Well, listen, I’ve spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And I’ll tell you, I’m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump. TRUMP: You don’t have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe. (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Take it from your professors... (CROSSTALK) CRUZ: The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused... TRUMP: He’s wrong. He’s wrong. CRUZ: ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. He’s a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore’s lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He’s a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And there’s a reason why Hillary’s supporters are echoing Donald’s attacks on me, because Hillary... TRUMP: He is not the only one. CRUZ: ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election. TRUMP: There are many lawyers. CRUZ: And I’ll tell you what, Donald, you — you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot. (LAUGHTER) I’ll tell you what. If this all works out, I’m happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day. TRUMP: No — no... (LAUGHTER) ... I think if it doesn’t... (APPLAUSE) I like that. I like it. I’d consider it. But I think I’ll go back to building buildings if it doesn’t work out. CRUZ: Actually, I’d love to get you to build a wall. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I have a feeling it’s going to work out, actually. (CROSSTALK) RUBIO: Let me (inaudible). I was invoked in that question, so let me just say — in that answer — let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV. (LAUGHTER) But the real — but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we — this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didn’t want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesn’t believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesn’t believe in the free enterprise system. This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. That’s why I’m running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I’m president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when I’m president, we’re not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When I’m president, we’re going to have a president that acts like it. BARTIROMO: Thank you, senator. BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address (APPLAUSE) BARITROMO: appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, “the siren call of the angriest voices”. She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party? TRUMP: Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I’m a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I’m a friend. We’re friends. That’s good. (LAUGHTER) But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, I’m not angry. I’m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we’re going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And I won’t be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I’m very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn’t offended. She said the truth. One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she’s right. I’m not fighting that. I didn’t find it offensive at all. I’m angry because our country is a mess. (APPLAUSE) BARITROMO: But what are you going to do about it? CAVUTO: Marco Rubio. I’m sorry, it’s the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well. The governor went so far to say, you won’t be able to slime your way to the White House. He’s referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,”One high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor? RUBIO: You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country’s security and expanding the role of... CAVUTO: That is not my question. RUBIO: Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is — this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding — less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned — he’s more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military. Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All I’m saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda. Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we don’t get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. We’re on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves. So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people. CAVUTO: Is he a liberal? RUBIO: Our next president... CAVUTO: Is he a liberal? RUBIO: Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions. CAVUTO: Governor? (APPLAUSE) CHRISTIE: I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we’re running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office. It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco’s ear too. (LAUGHTER) So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So let’s set the facts straight. First of all, I didn’t support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges. And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you’re a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you’re saying is accurate or not. When you’re a governor, you’re held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey, I’ve seen it. (APPLAUSE) And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, he’s changed his tune. I’m never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. He’s a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be. (APPLAUSE) BUSH: Neil, my name was mentioned here. Neil, my name was mentioned as well. Here’s the deal, Chris is totally right. He’s been a good governor, and he’s a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey. Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it’s going to be — this is not being bad. These attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybody’s record’s going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster. (APPLAUSE) Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn’t disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose. And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you’re going to hear in these ads, and discount the — the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton. CARSON: Neil, I was mentioned too. CAVUTO: You were? CARSON: Yeah, he said everybody. (LAUGHTER) And — and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we — and when I say we, Republicans — tore themselves apart. You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here. BARTIROMO: Governor Kasich... (APPLAUSE) ... Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. He’s now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it. So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesn’t think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee? KASICH: Well, if that’s the case, we’re going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. That’s not even an issue. But look... (APPLAUSE) ... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he’s not going to be president of the United States. So here’s this — the situation, I think, Maria. And this is what we have to — I — I’ve got to tell you, when wages don’t rise — and they haven’t for a lot of families for a number of years — it’s very, very difficult for them. Part of the reason why it hasn’t risen because sometimes we’re not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes it’s because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in — in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind. People are upset about it. I’ll tell you what else they’re upset about: you’re 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you’re out of work, and you don’t know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they’ve got great value. I’ll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can’t get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high — higher education, but we’ve got to make sure we’re training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay. (APPLAUSE) Let me tell you that, in this country — in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. They’re very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to — keeping them from getting it. That’s not the America that I’ve ever known. My father used to say, “Johnny, we never — we don’t hate the rich. We just want to be the rich.” And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education. And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America — and I mean everybody in America — having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father. I’m president — look, I’ve done it once. I’ve done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming. And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the — than the national average. A growth of 385,000 jobs. (BELL RINGS) It’s not that hard. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. Get it done, because our — our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And, folks, we will. You count on it. BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton’s past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct? CARSON: Well, there’s not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they’re married to somebody who’s running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, here’s the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles? You know, you look at what’s going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything — race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other’s throat and our strength is actually in our unity. You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section — you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let’s not let the secular progressives drive that out of us. The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They’ve been beaten into submission. It’s time for us to stand up for what we believe in. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Well, we are not done. Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/(inaudible). We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the debate is going so far. We’re back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Let’s get right back to the questions. Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them? BUSH: First of all, I’d like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the — (APPLAUSE) BUSH: The Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed. (APPLAUSE) BUSH: I don’t know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, here’s the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn’t fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do. We don’t need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not — would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens. That’s what they do, whether it’s the San Bernardino attack or if it’s these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn’t law-abiding gun owners. Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you’re going away. You’re going away for a long, long while. And that’s what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you’re going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there’s a big divide. The other issue is mental health. That’s a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this. (APPLAUSE) BUSH: The president’s first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn’t have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don’t have access to guns. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America? TRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn’t have 14 or 15 people dead right now. If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn’t have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct. We have a huge mental health problem in this country. We’re closing hospitals, we’re closing wards, we’re closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at what’s causing it. The guns don’t pull the trigger. It’s the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesn’t want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Thank you sir. XXX where you get Congress. TRUMP: You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order, executive order. It’s not supposed to happen that way. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take people’s guns away. Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesn’t sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners. RUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the president’s going to take their guns away. (APPLAUSE) Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it. I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it. Here’s my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he’s doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don’t buy their guns from a gun show. They don’t buy their guns from a collector. And they don’t buy their guns from a gun store. They get — they steal them. They get them on the black market. And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These... (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) ... his answer — you name it. If there’s an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here’s a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun. When I’m president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: But what fact can you point to, Senator — what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone’s gun? You don’t think that’s (inaudible)? RUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can’t wait to restrict people’s access to guns. He has never defended... (CROSSTALK) RUBIO: I’ll give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, “These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion.” That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this. This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment. (APPLAUSE) He doesn’t meet — here’s the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it’s not “how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans.” It’s “give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns.” That will never happen when I am president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president’s recent executive action on gun control, saying it’s unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasn’t your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, “These common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey’s already tough gun laws.” So isn’t that kind of what the president wants to do now? CHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that that’s not a democracy. That’s a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that. See, here’s the thing. I don’t think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don’t think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important. The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way we’ve done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. That’s what he is. I mean, you know... (APPLAUSE) ... the fact is, Neil, let’s think about — let’s think about — and I want to maybe — I hope the president is watching tonight, because here’s what I’d like to tell him. Mr. President, we’re not against you. We’re against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we’ve had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors. The American people have rejected your agenda and now you’re trying to go around it. That’s not right. It’s not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country? CRUZ: The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do — done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns? Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And I’ll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters — the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case. There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president’s going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns. And I’ll note that California senator — Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, “give me your guns, I’m rounding them up,” she would. And let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane... (LAUGHTER) ... that’s what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that people’s actions don’t always match their words. I’ve got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment. There’s a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There’s a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award... (BELL RINGS) ... and there’s a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans — we defeated that gun control legislation. And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight. BARTIROMO: Senator... (APPLAUSE) ... let me follow up and switch gears. Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, “embodies New York values.” Could you explain what you mean by that? CRUZ: You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: I am from New York. I don’t. CRUZ: What — what — you’re from New York? So you might not. (LAUGHTER) But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do. (APPLAUSE) And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media. And — and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked — my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the USA”, and I was asked what I thought of that. And I said, “well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, ‘New York, New York’?” And — and — you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out. The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he’s describing now. And his explanation — he said, “look, I’m from New York, that’s what we believe in New York. Those aren’t Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York.” And so that was his explanation. And — and I guess I can — can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I’m just saying. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: Are you sure about that? CAVUTO: Maria... TRUMP: So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand. (APPLAUSE) And just so — if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. I’ve had more calls on that statement that Ted made — New York is a great place. It’s got great people, it’s got loving people, wonderful people. When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred... (APPLAUSE) ... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I’ve never seen anything like it. And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death — nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we’ve been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles. Now you’ve claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush? BUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy’s going to be cut again. It’s now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm. The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don’t have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We’re gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were. We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we’re back in the game. Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, they’ve already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles. Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we’re back in the game with Israel — (APPLAUSE) ... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority. We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran’s provocations, I’m wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi’ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business. Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver’s seat. U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree? KASICH: Well, let me — let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you... (APPLAUSE) ... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved. With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it’s so critical for us to be energy independent, and we’re getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference. We’re seeing it in my state and we’ll see it in this country. And that’s why we must make sure we continue to frack. In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they’re funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether I’m president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we’re going to support you, we’re in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you’ve got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them. (APPLAUSE) So look, in foreign policy — in foreign policy, it’s strength, but you’ve got to be cool. You’ve got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And I’m going to tell you, that it — I’m going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can’t do on the job training. I’ve seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi’s — deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they’re going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done. Thank you. CAVUTO: Thank you John. BARTIROMO: There’s much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: We welcome back to the Republican Presidential Debate, right back to the questions. Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience. (APPLAUSE) He says, “the air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective.” Dr. Carson ... CARSON: Wait a minute, who in their 16th month? BARTIROMO: The air-strikes. CARSON: OK. BARTIROMO: Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops — ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS? CARSON: Well, there’s no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don’t believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is. I think we need to do a lot more than we’re doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them. The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, “what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?” Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don’t tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done. In addition to that... (APPLAUSE) ... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. You know, some of these — these engagement rules that the administration has — “we’re not going to bomb a tanker that’s coming out of there because there might be a person in it” — give me a break. Just tell them that, you put people in there, we’re going to bomb them. So don’t put people in there if you don’t want them bombed. You know, that’s so simple. (APPLAUSE) And then we need to shut down — we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa? We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time, then they won’t have time to plan attacks against us. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote, “The now king of Saudi Arabia told us, ‘you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.’ “The emir of Qatar said, ‘I’ll pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.’” Governor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it? CHRISTIE: Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about it — this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state — drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we’re going to attack. He used chemical weapons, he’s killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, he’s done worse than nothing. This president — and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer — she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today? We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we’re not going to have peace — we are not going to have peace in Syria. We’re not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don’t have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore. The Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldn’t be going to Europe. And here’s the last piece... (APPLAUSE) ... you’re not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. You’re simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this. And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together. And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if you’re going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you’re going to give her another four years, that’s why I’m speaking out as strongly as I am about that. Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started. That makes the world less peaceful, less safe. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them. BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. (APPLAUSE) Mr. Trump — Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm. According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue. Is there anything you’ve heard that makes you want to rethink this position? TRUMP: No. (LAUGHTER) No. (APPLAUSE) Look, we have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country that’s not going to have the kind of problems that we’ve had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the — with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world. I just left Indonesia — bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb. We have to find out what’s going on. I said temporarily. I didn’t say permanently. I said temporarily. And I have many great Muslim friends. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, “Donald, thank you very much; you’re exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it.” And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what’s going on, he can’t use the term for whatever reason. And if you can’t use the term, you’re never going to solve the problem. My Muslim friends, some, said, “thank you very much; we’ll get to the bottom of it.” But we have a serious problem. And we can’t be the stupid country any more. We’re laughed at all over the world. (APPLAUSE) BUSH: Donald, Donald — can I — I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. The Kurds are our strongest allies. They’re Muslim. You’re not going to even allow them to come to our country? The other Arab countries have a role to play in this. We cannot be the world’s policeman. We can’t do this unilaterally. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria. (APPLAUSE) So I hope you’ll reconsider. I hope you’ll reconsider. The better way of dealing with this — the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the — Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations. What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it’s harder if they’ve been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder — make the screening take place. We don’t have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security? CAVUTO: But you said — you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them. BUSH: Yeah, they are unhinged. CAVUTO: Well — well, after he made them... (APPLAUSE) ... his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina. Now — now, wait... TRUMP: Eleven points, to be exact. CAVUTO: Are you — are you saying — are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged? BUSH: No, not at all, absolutely not. I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. I totally get that. But we’re running for the presidency of the United States here. This isn’t — this isn’t, you know, a different kind of job. You have to lead. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it’s just politics. Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I’m asking him to consider changing his views. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I want security for this country. OK? (APPLAUSE) I want security. I’m tired of seeing what’s going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. It’s not only a problem here. It’s a problem all over the world. I want to find out why those two young people — those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them — people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. I want to find out — many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. Why weren’t they vigilant? Why didn’t they call? Why didn’t they call the police? According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party’s nomination for president. And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will tell you that. (APPLAUSE) The most mistreated people. In fact, we need to — wait a minute — we need vigilance. We have to find out — many people knew about what was going on. Why didn’t they turn those two people in so that you wouldn’t have had all the death? There’s something going on and it’s bad. And I’m saying we have to get to the bottom of it. That’s all I’m saying. We need security. BARTIROMO: We — we want to hear from all of you on this. According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said? Beginning with you, Governor Kasich. KASICH: I — I’ve been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. And the reasons why I’ve done is I don’t believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. But you know, we don’t want to put everybody in the same category. And I’ll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If we’re going to have a coalition, we’re going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan. We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War. (BELL RINGS) It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we’re going to need it again. And if we try to put everybody in the same — call everybody the same thing, we can’t do it. And that’s just not acceptable. But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio. BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you, Governor Christie, your take. CHRISTIE: Now Maria, listen. I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. That’s the end of the conversation. I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. Here’s the way you need to deal with it. You can’t just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us. The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe. (BELL RINGS) And this summer, we didn’t do that. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I’m president, we’ll make our intelligence community strong, and won’t have to keep everybody out, we’re just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don’t harm us. BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio, where do you stand? RUBIO: Well, first of all, let’s understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that’s out there about this whole issue. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS. If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. They are much more than that. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides. This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. This is not some small scale group. They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, it’s a very simple equation, and it’s going to happen when I’m president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, where do you stand? Senator Cruz? CRUZ: You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism. I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. What should we do? First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I’ve introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I’ve introduced... (BELL RINGS) ... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists. If I’m elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS (APPLAUSE). BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, where do you stand? Do you agree with Mr. Trump? CARSON: Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. But like all of our problems, there isn’t a single one that can’t be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country. That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. They have infrastructure. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country. And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. Let’s listen to them and let’s not listen to our politicians. BARTIROMO: So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump? BUSH: So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies — that we need to build better relationships with? Of course not. What we need to do is destroy ISIS. I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a “No Fly Zone” and “Safe Zones” to make sure refugees are there. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. We need to embed with — with the Iraqi military. We need to arm the Kurds the directly. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis. We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters. That’s how you solve the problem. You don’t solve it by big talk where you’re banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful. BARTIROMO: Thank you governor. CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back. Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, “up to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.” TRUMP: That’s wrong. They were wrong. It’s the New York Times, they are always wrong. CAVUTO: Well... TRUMP: They were wrong. CAVUTO: You never said because they provided that... TRUMP: No, I said, “ I would use — “ they were asking me what to do about North Korea. China, they don’t like to tell us but they have total control — just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us. They say, “ well, we don’t really have control.” Without China, North Korea doesn’t even eat. China is ripping us on trade. They’re devaluing their currency and they’re killing our companies. Thousands of thousands — you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we’ve lost — 50,000 because of China. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: So they’ve never said to put a tariff on their... TRUMP: We’ve lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, “we have very unfair trade with China. We’re going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China.” A lot of that is because they devalue their currency. What I said to the New York Times, is that, “we have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount — where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get.” That we should get. What I’m saying is this, I’m saying that we do it but if they don’t start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don’t lose all of these millions of jobs that we’re losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year? CAVUTO: I’m sorry, you lost me. TRUMP: It’s not that complicated actually. CAVUTO: Then I apologize. Then I want to understand, if you don’t want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn’t the figure, would you be open — are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them? TRUMP: OK, just so you understand — I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me. CAVUTO: I know... TRUMP: Carl said, “no, no — “ but he’s somebody — these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don’t know what they’re doing and we have problems like this. If these are the kinds of people — we should use our best and our finest. Now, on that tariff — here’s what I’m saying, China — they send their goods and we don’t tax it — they do whatever they want to do. They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You don’t know it, they tax us. I have many friends that deal with China. They can’t — when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal — so we don’t have an equal playing field. I’m saying, absolutely, we don’t have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China. I’m a free trader. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. I sell tens’ of millions of (inaudible). I love China. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can’t believe how stupid the American leadership is. CAVUTO: So you’re open to a tariff? TRUMP: I’m totally open to a tariff. If they don’t treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You can’t deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we don’t it. It’s not fair trade. KASICH: Neil, Neil — can I say one thing about this. I’m a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because it’s important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China — Donald’s right about North Korea. I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don’t proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what he’s touching — talking about, I think has got merit. And I’ll allow putting that tariff or whatever he’s saying here... TRUMP: I’m happy to have him tonight... (LAUGHTER) KASICH: For too long — no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people’s jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The worker’s out of a job. So when they — be found against that country that’s selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didn’t work out for you. I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need — we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy. And I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn’t work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they’re hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they’re Americans and they carry the load. So let’s demand open trade but fair trade in this country. That’s what I think we need to do. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: All right. RUBIO: But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here’s why. China doesn’t pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there’s a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer. So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy. It begins with tax reform. Let’s not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let’s allow companies to immediately expense. (APPLAUSE) It continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us. How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day. TRUMP: Neil, the problem — BARTIROMO: We’re getting — TRUMP: — with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they’re sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just — you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just can’t do it any longer. CAVUTO: He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, it’s Americans who pay. BUSH: Absolutely. TRUMP: You looking at me? BUSH: Yeah. BARTIROMO: Prices go higher for — TRUMP: Can I tell you what? It will never happen because they’ll let their currency go up. They’re never going to let it happen. Japan, the same thing. They are devaluing — it’s so impossible for — you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what’s happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph). Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they’ve de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can’t buy a Caterpillar tractor. And we’re letting them get away with it and we can’t let them get away with it. And that’s why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys. (APPLAUSE) BUSH: Here’s — apart from the — apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation. BARTIROMO: Yeah. BUSH: So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes — the equivalent of it goes to China. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn’t retaliate and start buying Airbus? Of course, they would. This would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States. BARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator — go ahead, Senator Cruz. (APPLAUSE) And then we have to get to tax reform. TRUMP: And we don’t need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Because that’s what we’d get if it were Jeb — I tell you what, we don’t need that. AUDIENCE: Boo. TRUMP: We don’t need that. That’s essentially what we have now, and we don’t need that. And that’s why we’re in the trouble that we’re in now. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. They don’t want them made here. They want those planes made in China. BUSH: They’re a mile away from here. TRUMP: That’s not the way the game is supposed to be played. BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Bush. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Very briefly. BUSH: My name was mentioned. My name was mentioned here. The simple fact is that the plane that’s being build here is being sold to China. You can — if you — you flew in with your 767, didn’t you? Right there, right next to the plant. TRUMP: No, the new planes. I’m not talking about now, I’m talking about in the future they’re building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it. BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trump. BUSH: When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the — BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trmup. Thank you, Governor. TRUMP: I’ll check for you. BUSH: Check it out. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: Senator briefly. CRUZ: Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered. You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. They discussed how — how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. They’re protectionist. History suggests that each party’s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling. But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they’ll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports. So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I’ve introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS... (APPLAUSE) ... and here’s the critical point, Maria — the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they’re border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever. It’s tax-free — a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers — and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. It’s like a tariff, but here’s the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds. The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there’s no reciprocal... (BELL RINGS) ... tariffs that come against us. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home... (UNKNOWN): Maria... CRUZ: ... and as president, I’m going to fight for the working men and women. (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: We’ve got to get to tax reform, gentlemen. We’ve got to get to tax reform, and we’ve got to get to the... (UNKNOWN): Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes. BARTIROMO: ... we’ve got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions. (APPLAUSE) Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020. Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank? CHRISTIE: Well, I’m glad you asked that, Maria. Here’s — here’s our plan. We’ve all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform. If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world — and we double tax, as you know. And what that’s led to over $2 trillion of American companies’ monies that are being kept offshore, because they don’t want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They don’t want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given — bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. Bring the money — the $2 trillion — back to the United States. We’ll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. It would not necessitate us raising any taxes. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And — and — and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. He’s penalized — and doesn’t understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers. You’ve seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. That’s wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. We’d rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we’d work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. And remember this — I’m credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I’ve vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We don’t need to raise taxes to get this done. We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists. All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration. BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson... (APPLAUSE) ... it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America. Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether? CARSON: Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that’s what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody — no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others. You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I — my — my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but — you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar. I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn’t make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But... (LAUGHTER) ... you know, the — the — the fact of the matter is — you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations — because every regulation is a tax, it’s a — on goods and services. And it’s the most regressive tax there is. You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up — you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register. And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our — our — our people like this. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it’s those evil rich people. It’s not the evil rich people. It’s the evil government that is — that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can’t survive. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Senator Rubio... TRUMP: Maria — Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. It’s one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs — leave them behind. They’re leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can’t get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they can’t get along. They can’t even make a deal. Here is the case, they both agree, they can’t make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country. BARTIROMO: Which is why we raised it. Senator Rubio? Thank you, Mr. Trump. TRUMP: Thank you. BARTIROMO: One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure? RUBIO: Well, first let me address the tax issue because it’s related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: Here is the one thing I’m not going to do. I’m not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. It’s called the value added tax. And it’s a tax you find in many companies in Europe. Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees. And that’s why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that’s what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them. Now, you can support one now that’s very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they don’t get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees. When I am president of the United States, I’m going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Thank you senator. CRUZ: Maria, I assume that I can respond to that. BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course. CRUZ: Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good. This is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax. If you’re a farmer, if you’re a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marco’s tax plan and mine. Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. Marco’s top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all... (BELL RINGS) ... the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan’s chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest. BARTIROMO: Thank you senator. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: But that’s not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that’s going to collect your vat tax. Someone’s going to be collecting this tax. In fact, Ronald Reagan’s treasury, when Ronald Reagan’s treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it. The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees. So there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? You’re going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don’t see it on the bill. And that’s why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid... (BELL RINGS) and they decide, we’re going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we’re going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, you’ve got Europe. (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump. CRUZ: Maria... BARTIROMO: Yes. CRUZ: Maria, I’d just like to say... (CROSSTALK) CHRISTIE: Maria, I’d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements. And the reason — and the reason... (CROSSTALK) CHRISTIE: ... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Here’s the thing. (CROSSTALK) CHRISTIE: The fact is, the reason why... RUBIO: If you’ll answer the (inaudible) core question. CHRISTIE: ... the fact is — the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it’s hard. It’s a hard problem. And I’m the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this — avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you. Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she’s moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this. We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress — this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that. And the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that’s why I’m answering your question. BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. (APPLAUSE) CARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying. BARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson. Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. We’ll be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next. More from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business. Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America’s interest first? TRUMP: Well, it’s an interesting question because I’m very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldn’t care less about my company. It’s peanuts. I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. I’m going to do it for America. So I would — I would be willing to do that. BARTIROMO: So you’ll put your assets in a blind trust? TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I don’t know if it’s a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If that’s a blind trust, I don’t know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn’t ever be involved because I wouldn’t care about anything but our country, anything. BARTIROMO: Thank you sir. TRUMP: Thank you. CAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, “most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington.” Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, “police are being less proactive because they’re being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they’re afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.” What would you do as president to address this? CHRISTIE: Well, first off, let’s face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, “there’s a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country.” Here’s why, the president of the United States and both his attorney’s general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers. That’s the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time he’s got a chance, going all the way back to — remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys. Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here’s the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. That’s where crime is happening in these cities where they don’t enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back — this president doesn’t enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn’t agree with them. And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that’s illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Here’s what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I’d say, “General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.” We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I’m the only person on this stage who’s done that and we will get it done as President of the United States. CAVUTO: Thank you governor. Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago’s move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns? KASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety. KASICH: And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police. KASICH: And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for — for training. But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not — not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them. At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn’t work for them, but works against them. See, in Ohio, we’ve had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, it’s all about communication, folks. It’s all about getting people to listen to one another’s problems. And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. I’ve heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I’ve got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can’t do it alone. You’ve got to bring people together. You’ve got to give people hope. And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is what’s so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio? (APPLAUSE) Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years. Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work? RUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue that’s been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who’s in this country, maybe they’re here illegally, but they’re looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore. First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And here’s why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They’re looking — they’re recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border. They’re looking — they’re looking to manipulate our — the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether it’s green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I’m president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America. BARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed? RUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us. The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because they’re recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They’ve contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance. This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I’m president we will. BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It’s the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it’s clear now, that border security is national security. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator. CRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama’s power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him — the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks. I think that’s a mistake. That’s why I’ve been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you don’t get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists. RUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. RUBIO: Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you’re against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you’re against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you’re against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it. And by the way, it’s not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you’re against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason. (APPLAUSE) That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason. (APPLAUSE) And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense. Here’s the bottom line, and I’ll close with this. If I’m president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond. (APPLAUSE) BUSH: There’s — look, there’s — CAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen — CRUZ: I’m going to get a response to that, Neil. There’s no way he launches 11 attack — CAVUTO: Very quick, very quick. CRUZ: I’m going to — he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your (inaudible) research folder on the debate stage. RUBIO: No, it’s your record. CRUZL But I will say — CAVUTO: Do you think they like each other? CRUZ: — at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. They’re absolutely false. AUDIENCE: Boo. CRUZ: So let’s start — let’s start with immigration. Let’s start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship. And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it’s simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe. CAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, we’ve got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that. (APPLAUSE) Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last debate, the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well. Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise? BUSH: I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators — back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind. The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff — CAVUTO: Would you answer this question? BUSH: Oh, I’ll talk about that, too. But you haven’t asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I’d get that off my chest if you don’t mind. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook — so Tim Cook says he’s going to keep it private. BUSH: I got that. And the problem today is there’s no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that there’s a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they’re not fearful of a lawsuit. We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is — that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So it’s not just the government — the private sector companies, it’s also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game. We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector. CAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President. BUSH: You’ve got to keep asking. You’ve got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship — CAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order? BUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we — if we are too punitive, then you’ll go to other — other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this. We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So there’s a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. That’s what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you’re talking about amendments that don’t even actually are part of a bill that ever passed. CAVUTO: Governor, thank you. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: When we come right back, closing statements. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Candidates, it is time for your closing statements. You get 60 seconds each. Governor John Kasich, we begin with you. KASICH: You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don’t have the power. You know, they feel like if they don’t have a lobbyist, if they’re not wealthy, that somehow they don’t get to play. But all of my career, you know, having been raised in — by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. You see, all of my career, I’ve fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me. Whether it’s welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it’s engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it’s taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. Look, that’s who I stand up for. That’s who’s in my mind (BELL RINGS) And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you’re the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Governor Bush? BUSH: Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth. Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I’ve laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones. Credibility counts. There’ll be people here that will talk about what they’re going to do. I’ve done it. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Governor Chris Christie? CHRISTIE: Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight. When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week — the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they’re feeling. They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn’t understand their pain, and doesn’t have any plan for getting away from it. I love this country. It’s the most exceptional country the world has ever known. We need someone to fight for the people. We need a fighter for this country again. I’ve lived my whole life fighting — fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests. But here’s the best way that we’re going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again. I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Dr. Ben Carson? CARSON: You know, in recent travels around this country, I’ve encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups. We’re not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. The only way we’re going to solve this problem is with we, the people. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Bencarson.com — we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Senator Marco Rubio? RUBIO: You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don’t come from government. Our rights come from God. That’s why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. That’s why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle. But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like we’re being left behind and left out. And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn’t interested in fixing America. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world. And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. And that’s why 2016 is a turning point in our history. If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country. But if we elect the right person — if you elect me — we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been. (APPLAUSE) CAVUTO: Senator Ted Cruz? CRUZ: “13 Hours” — tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them. I want to speak to all our fighting men and women. I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who’s responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women. I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. This will end. It will end on January 2017. And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Mr. Donald Trump? TRUMP: I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. They’re tough, they’re strong, they’re great people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up. And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. It was a terrible sight. A terrible sight. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. If I’m president, there won’t be stupid deals anymore. We will make America great again. We will win on everything we do. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) BARTIROMO: Candidates, thank you. CAVUTO: Gentlemen, thank you all. All of you. That wraps up our debate. We went a little bit over here. But we wanted to make sure everyone was able to say their due. He’s upset. All right. Thank you for joining us. Much more to come in the Spin Room ahead."
614,"Paul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and current counsel at the New York law firm of Edelman & Edelman PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases. Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN)Stormy Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, has a talent for stirring the publicity pot relating to his controversial porn star client. He dropped his latest morsels Friday during a drive-by of CNN and MSNBC's morning shows.  In an interview with Chris Cuomo of CNN's ""New Day,"" he said six additional women had come forward alleging sexual relationships with President Donald Trump and that his office was in the ""early stages of vetting those stories."" Avenatti also claimed two of the women have nondisclosure agreements.   Avenatti also told Cuomo that Daniels has faced physical threats, saying she'll disclose more details in an upcoming ""60 Minutes"" interview later this month. He would not answer whether or not it was someone close to the President who threatened her, and later told CNN he couldn't answer a question about whether he or Daniels filed a police report.  If Avenatti's statements are true, the interviews suggest that it may be time for Robert Mueller to meet Stormy Daniels. His investigation should focus on possible election law violations relating to the $130,000 hush money payment given to her.  The purchase of the silence of Ms. Daniels or possibly other women may be viewed by the Mueller team as unreported ""in-kind"" campaign contributions if the payoff was made to advance the Trump presidential candidacy. Such activity might be viewed as either a civil or criminal offense depending upon the facts of the case. A threat of ""physical harm"" to prevent a potential witness from providing relevant information to criminal investigators would constitute a clear-cut obstruction of justice and might violate other state and federal criminal statutes, as well.  The President's personal, self-described ""pit bull"" lawyer, Michael Cohen, admits to setting up a Delaware corporation, Essential Consultants, LLC to pay the porn star $130,000 in hush money to never speak of sexual encounters he claims the President ""vehemently denies.""     Stranger still, the agreement in excruciating detail requires that Ms. Daniels must deliver to the President ""every existing copy of all ... video images, still images, email messages, ... or any other type of creation by DD"" (the President). (See  Section 3.1  of the Settlement Agreement.) Later, the agreement defines ""confidential information"" as ""all intangible information pertaining to DD"" (the President) ... ""including but not limited to ... any of his alleged sexual partners, alleged sexual actions or alleged sexual conduct or related matters."" (See Settlement Agreement 4.1(a).) To cut through the legalese, it would seem that the President's personal lawyer was seeking Stormy Daniels' silence as well as copies of -- and non-disclosure of -- images, photographs and video of the President engaging in sexual conduct that he says never happened.  This would appear to be a great deal for Ms. Daniels who, if Mr. Cohen is believed, is getting $130,000 to turn over nothing since the President never had an affair with her.  Nonetheless, she has hired lawyers to get her out of the agreement. She may well believe that she can earn a lot more than $130,000 if she markets her story of an affair with the President, and, of course, the sky is the limit on income if she has Mr. Trump on videotape. Attorney Cohen adds yet another curious detail stating he has paid the entire $130,000 Stormy silence fee personally, obtaining the money through a home equity line of credit on his home.  Neither the Trump campaign nor the ""Trump Organization"" was involved, he says. Cohen will presumably assert that he didn't personally violate federal election campaign laws because he was acting as a personal friend of Donald Trump's, protecting his friend's reputation -- which mimics the successful defense in the John Edwards' criminal prosecution. Friends of Edwards had contributed nearly $1 million to hide the candidate's pregnant mistress while Edwards ran for president. Edwards obtained a partial acquittal -- on the charge that he violated campaign laws -- at trial and prosecutors declined to prosecute on the remaining criminal charges upon which the jury had been unable to reach a verdict.  If Stormy Daniels reveals in her ""60 Minutes"" interview the details of her alleged sexual encounters with the President, she may well face a claim for damages as high as $20 million under the terms of her NDA agreement with EEC,LLC . That agreement has yet to be ruled illegal by any court. The real question, though, is whether Robert Mueller will view the agreement as a criminal violation of US election laws. If he does, the NDA may have an impact on Mr. Trump similar to the impact that a very famous blue dress had on Bill Clinton. "
615,"(Adds government statement, Congress comment) NEW DELHI, March 27 (Reuters) - India’s Election Commission said it had directed a committee of officers to examine Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of an anti-satellite test on Wednesday, after opposition leaders complained the move was aimed at scoring political points. In a television address to the nation, Modi said an Indian missile had shot down an Indian satellite in space, making India only the fourth country after the United States, Russia and China to have that capability. Opposition leader Mamata Banerjee said she was lodging a complaint against Modi with the Election Commission for violating the electoral code of conduct. “Today’s announcement is yet another limitless drama and publicity-mongering by Modi desperately trying to reap political benefits at the time of election (in April-May),” Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal state and a potential prime ministerial candidate, said on Twitter. Randeep Singh Surjewala, a spokesman for the main opposition Congress party, called Modi’s announcement a “gross violation of code of conduct.” The Election Commission said in a statement later that the matter had been brought to its notice. “The Commission has directed a Committee of Officers to examine the matter immediately in the light of Model Code of Conduct,” it said, without elaborating.

Elizabeth Warren said she wouldn't step aside before the Democratic convention if none of her presidential rivals reach the number of delegates required to clinch the party's nomination before then.  It was the biggest headline in a marathon night of town halls from South Carolina. Over four hours, former Vice President Joe Biden displayed his ability to make deep connections over faith. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg gave his clearest answer yet on stop-and-frisk policing. And Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar expanded her definition of the Midwest.  Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The candidates also weighed in on President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus.  Here are five takeaways from the second night of CNN town halls in South Carolina:  Warren is ready to run all the way to the convention Warren said she's willing to take her presidential campaign to the convention this summer if none of the candidates clinch a winning delegate majority during the primary. According to party rules, if none of the candidates reach that number, Democratic superdelegates -- who are not elected -- would get to vote on a second ballot. That could create an awkward -- and potentially contentious -- floor fight as candidates jockey to win over those unbound delegates. Asked by an audience member why the person who gets the most votes shouldn't be awarded the nomination, Warren said that the rules set a higher bar -- and she would be open to fighting to the last. She also suggested that Bernie Sanders' argument that a candidate with a plurality should be declared the nominee was inconsistent with what his campaign publicly argued in 2016, when he was losing to Hillary Clinton. Then, the Sanders campaign argued that a candidate who won the most delegates shouldn't necessarily win the nomination if he or she didn't reach a majority.  In the aftermath of that primary, in which the superdelegates overwhelmingly backed Clinton, Sanders and others struck a deal to dilute their power. Unlike four years ago, they will only be able to vote on a second ballot in 2020. ""The way I see this is, you write the rules before you know where everybody stands. And then you stick with those rules. So for me, Bernie had a big hand in writing these rules. I didn't write them,"" Warren said. Biden shows his humanity Biden reminded voters on Wednesday what made him a beloved figure in the Democratic Party. Biden, with tears in his eyes, connected with a pastor whose wife was killed in the 2015 Charleston church shooting by reflecting on the repeated tragedies that have impacted his life, including the death of his wife and daughter in 1972 and the death of his son Beau in 2015. ""I kind of know what it's like to lose family. And my heart goes out to you,"" Biden said, his eyes welling. The answer showcased Biden's ability to connect with voters on an emotional level, a skill that even the former vice president's fiercest critics often commend. Biden recalled how he came back to Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the site of the shooting that killed nine people in 2015, the Sunday after the shooting ""because I had just lost my son and I wanted some hope."" ""I don't know how you've dealt with it, reverend, but the way I've been able to deal with when my wife was killed and my daughter was killed and my son died, I've only been able to deal with it by realizing they're part of my being,"" Biden said. ""My son, Beau, was my soul."" South Carolina is central to Biden's campaign and he needs a good showing here to propel his campaign. But on Wednesday night, Biden's answer was about more than just electoral politics -- it was about the former vice president's ability to show empathy for another human and his power to overcome personal tragedy. Bloomberg finds his footing in town hall format Bloomberg's first two debates were struggles -- but on the town hall stage Wednesday night, he looked more comfortable.  The former New York City mayor gave his clearest answer yet on the stop-and-frisk policing he implemented during his time in office.  ""We just did it much too much and an awful lot of innocent people got stopped who didn't have guns. And it was my mistake, and I apologized for it,"" Bloomberg said.  He also slammed Sanders on the one issue where Bloomberg has been to the left of where Sanders was in the early 1990s: Gun control.  He said of Sanders' past opposition to the Brady Act, ""If that isn't being in NRA's pocket, I don't know what is."" Klobuchar expands the meaning of Midwest Klobuchar's core argument is her electability in the Midwest -- where she's cruised in Senate races in a battleground state and believes she could reverse the Democratic losses of 2016.  But a South Carolina voter, feeling excluded, pressed her on whether that Midwestern pitch would isolate the coasts.  Klobuchar said she actually defines the Midwest as ""the states that feel that they've been left behind some in terms of focus in the 2016 election.""  ""I would include states like South Carolina, and my plan is actually to build a beautiful blue wall of Democratic votes in this coalition of independents and moderate Republicans around states including states like South Carolina, and make Donald Trump pay for it,"" she said.  Klobuchar regularly touts connections to the Midwest, arguing her ""grit"" and ""determination"" come from her upbringing in Minnesota. Candidates condemn Trump's response to coronavirus All four of the Democratic candidates faulted Trump's response to the spread of the coronavirus on Wednesday night, especially the fact that Vice President Mike Pence will now lead the administration's effort. Klobuchar said she would ""put a medical professional in charge."" ""I think we want to make sure that everything is done in the right way and that's the job of Congress to perform oversight,"" she added. Warren announced she would use border wall funding to combat coronavirus and brought up the face that Pence, as governor of Indiana, hesitated in green-lighting a needle exchange program designed to stop the spread of HIV in a rural Indiana county, contributing to the outbreak spread and at least 200 people were infected.  ""Do keep in mind that this Vice President has dealt with a public health emergency before -- in Indiana. And what was his approach? To put politics over science and let a serious virus expand in his state and cost people lives,"" she said. Biden lamented the fact that the United States does not have experts in China, and that fact that Trump is now ""on the same page as the scientists."" And Bloomberg, after he was informed Pence was leading the charge, sarcastically said, ""I feel so much better."" ""The bottom line,"" he continued, ""is we are not ready for this kind of thing."" "
617,"WASHINGTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that aircraft operators must inspect 165 Boeing 737 NG airplanes for structural cracks within seven days after the issue was found on a small number of planes. Boeing Co notified the FAA of the issue after it discovered structural cracks on an aircraft undergoing modifications in China. The FAA said subsequent inspections found similar cracks in a small number of additional planes. The FAA said planes with fewer flights will eventually get inspected. The order covers 1,911 U.S. registered planes. The 737 NG is the third-generation 737 and version before the now grounded 737 MAX, which is not impacted by the issue. Boeing said Friday it has been in contact with 737 NG operators about the discovery of cracks, but added that ""no in-service issues have been reported.""

618,"(Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) is slashing vehicle production by as much as 20 percent in North America to cope with falling profitability in the United States, its biggest sales market, Japan’s Nikkei business daily reported on Monday. Japan’s No. 2 automaker has been slowing production in the United States, where an aggressive ramp-up in vehicle sales has come at the cost of increased discounting and fleet sales, which has eroded profitability in the world’s second-largest auto market. Cuts are already in progress at two assembly plants in the United States and three in Mexico, the Nikkei said, adding that employees will not be let go, and production lines will not be completely halted, with the cutbacks expected to wrap up later this year. Nissan said that the report was not based on any announcement by the company. U.S. production of Nissan vehicles, including the popular Rogue crossover SUV and its high-volume Altima sedan fell 9.2 percent in the year ended March, company figures show, following a period of increased sales in 2016. The automaker earlier this month repeated that it was shifting its U.S. strategy to one of sustained profitability from one which focused on aggressive growth, and that it had been lowering plant utilization to enable its dealers to sell down built-up inventories. Nissan has seen U.S. sales slide around 6.5 percent so far in 2018, partly due to sluggish demand for its high-volume Altima sedan, a revamped model of which will be released later this year. Price discounts for the Altima, the popular Rogue crossover SUV and other models were a big factor in the 30.5 percent drop in Nissan’s North American operating profit in the year just ended. Since 2010, the automaker has roughly doubled car sales in the region to around 1.6 million units, in line with a target to corner around a 10 percent share of the U.S. vehicle market. But achieving that has come at the cost of hefty discounting in the region, and Nissan has said it now plans to focus on improving profitability in North America, while also expanding sales in China, the world’s biggest car market. Nissan operates two manufacturing plants in the United States, and three in Mexico. Roughly 60 percent of all of its vehicles sold in the United States are produced locally.

620,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s President Michel Temer has made policy and spending concessions in an effort to survive a congressional vote on corruption charges Wednesday that has put his reform agenda at risk, analysts and political actors said. To please the powerful farm lobby that has two-fifths of the votes in the lower house, Temer agreed to lower fines for environmental damage. He attempted to relax a definition of slave labor but was forced to backtrack after an outcry. In the clearest move to favor an ally, the Republican Party that has 37 seats in the 512-seat chamber and runs the Transport Ministry, Temer removed Sao Paulo’s busy and lucrative Congonhas airport from a list of airports to be privatized. The party has appointees in the ministry and state airport operator Infraero. Critics and political observers say Temer has sacrificed austerity policies to save his presidency but will emerge from Wednesday’s vote a weakened leader unable to pass substantial measures, such as an overhaul of the pension system. Temer faces charges in a bribery case based on testimony by an owner of the world’s largest meatpacker JBS SA that has implicated several of his cabinet ministers. The lower house decides whether a president should stand trial before the Supreme Court, which can only take place if two-thirds of deputies vote for it. “He will survive because he has a majority, though not my vote because I believe there is enough evidence to put him on trial by the Supreme Court,” said Fabio Sousa, a lawmaker of the centrist the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), a member of Temer’s governing coalition. Temer managed to block a first corruption charge in August. Now he faces charges of obstruction of justice and criminal organization for allegedly receiving bribes from JBS. Temer has met with dozens of lawmakers in recent days to secure their votes. Presidential aides said he hopes to widen his margin of support so that he can move ahead with his reforms, paralyzed for six months by the political crisis. Those votes come at a cost, in pork-barrel spending. According to public spending watchdog Contas Abertas, Temer fast-tracked spending in congressional districts worth 4.4 billion reais ($1.3 billion) to help win the first vote, and is now hitting the 2 billion real mark ahead of Wednesday’s vote. O Globo newspaper estimated the cost of Temer’s handouts to taxpayers at 12 billion reais, half of which would have come from the planned airport concession auction. Yet most analysts believe Temer will get less votes this time, because lawmakers have started to distance themselves from his government ahead of next year’s general elections. “After this vote, Temer will become a lame duck president. It will be very difficult for him to pass any reforms,” said David Fleischer, politics professor emeritus at Brasilia University. Investors are waiting to see if Temer can deliver a pension reform to tackle a budget deficit that cost brazil its investment grade credit rating. “If he does get social security reform approved, it will be badly watered down,” Fleischer said.

621,"MEXICO CITY, April 20 (Reuters) - A Mexican judge has blocked a company associated with U.S. toymaker Mattel Inc from commercializing the image of artist Frida Kahlo, her family says, as it seeks to halt sales of a Barbie doll styled after the influential artist. Mattel, which manufactures Hot Wheels toys and Barbies, launched an “inspiring women” series of dolls featuring the late painter in March. The company said at the time that it had reached an agreement to manufacture the doll with the Frida Kahlo Corporation, which says on its website that it owns the trademark rights to the artist’s image worldwide. But Mara Romero, Kahlo’s grand niece, has told local media the rights belong to her and her family. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, the family’s official account, @FridaKahlo, wrote that a Mexico City judge had ordered the Frida Kahlo Corporation to stop using the “brand, image and work of the illustrious painter Frida Kahlo” without permission from the owner of the rights. Reuters was unable to determine to which court the family was referring, and the family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did representatives for Mattel in Mexico or the Frida Kahlo Corporation. Kahlo’s image and her extensive body of work have been widely commercialized as the artist’s popularity has grown. Since her death in 1954, Kahlo, who was married to Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, has been regarded as one of the greatest painters of the 20th century for her moving and intimate self -portraits, reflecting her personal experience of pain and isolation. Mattel’s Barbie also drew the family’s ire because it lacks the artist’s signature unibrow, which has become a symbol of her feminist stance.

622,"William A. Ackman, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, is paring back a stake in a health care stock. But it is not the one that has been generating lots of negative headlines. On Monday, Pershing set out to sell 16.85 million shares in Zoetis, the former animal health arm of Pfizer, for a price range of $46.75 to $47 per share, according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly. The transaction is expected to be valued around $800 million and will be managed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse. Pershing will continue to own 25 million shares in the company. The hedge fund paid $1.5 billion for an 8.5 percent stake in Zoetis in November 2014, according a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stock has since gained 8.6 percent. Last year, Zoetis added William F. Doyle, a representative for Pershing Square, to its board of directors. On April 22, Pershing Square said Mr. Doyle, would step down from the board of Zoetis this week. It has been a difficult year for Mr. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Holdings fund is down 18 percent, dragged down in large part by a 9 percent position in Valeant, the pharmaceutical company that has come under intense political and regulatory scrutiny. The fund has concentrated positions in a dozen companies, making the portfolio vulnerable to sharp declines in just one or two holdings. Mr. Ackman may be selling the shares to raise cash in response to investor redemption requests or in order to make a new investment. Pershing Square trimmed its stake in another holding in March, selling 20 million shares in Mondelez International, the food and beverage company. At the time of the sale, Mondelez shares were down 7 percent for the year. Representatives from Pershing Square and Credit Suisse declined to comment. A representative from Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment."
623,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Reinstating border controls within Europe’s passport-free Schengen zone because of the migrant crisis would significantly increase costs for Germany’s foreign trade, national trade organizations told German media on Wednesday. “About 70 percent of German foreign trade takes place within Europe, particularly with countries of the euro zone,” Anton Boerner, head of the BGA trade federation, told newspaper Tagesspiegel. “The cost for international road transport alone would increase by about three billion euros ($3.27 billion).” Stefan Genth, head of the HDE retail group, said checks would severely impact the transport of goods throughout Europe due to delays at the borders. European Union member states are bitterly divided over the handling of an influx of migrants and refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and North Africa. Germany took in 1.1 million last year. The failure to agree on joint measures to handle the crisis has put the Schengen zone, with its 26 European members, on the verge of collapse. German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt on Monday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to prepare to close the country’s borders to stem the influx, arguing Berlin must act alone if it cannot reach a Europe-wide deal on refugees. Merkel has resisted calls to shut the borders and tried to convince other European countries to take in quotas of refugees, pushed for reception centers to be built on Europe’s external borders and led an EU campaign to convince Turkey to keep refugees from entering the bloc. But pressure to put a cap on the number of refugees entering Germany is growing on Merkel after women were sexually assaulted in the western city of Cologne on New Year’s Eve. Police have blamed many of the attacks on groups of migrant men, mainly from North Africa. On Tuesday, European Council President Donald Tusk said Europe had no more than two months to get the migration crisis under control and prevent a collapse of its passport-free travel zone. Foreign trade last year contributed 0.2 percent to Germany’s gross domestic product. Reporting by Tina Bellon; Editing by Janet Lawrence"
624,"EARLIER THIS MONTH, a decommissioned Boeing 747 airliner was towed down a Dutch motorway to its final destination as a novelty hotel complex. Its owners reckon they can turn the jumbo-jet into a tourist attraction. They are not wrong. Sweden’s Stockholm Arlanda Airport is already using one as a hostel (its best room is where the pilots used to sit). In Bahrain, developers are planning to turn a submerged 747 into the centrepiece of a new underwater theme park. Having celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 747’s first flight this month, fans of the iconic jumbo jet know that it is falling out of favour with airlines. Before long, ground-based encounters will be the only way of getting up close and personal with these planes. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. To say that the 747 revolutionised air travel when it entered commercial service in 1970 is an understatement. Saying it opened the skies to the masses is closer to the mark. As the first passenger plane ever built with a twin-aisle cabin configuration, it was twice the size of its predecessor, the Boeing 707. That gave airlines the economies of scale they needed to sell cheap tickets on long-haul routes for the first time. Its roomier cabins, with less noise from jet engines, made long-haul travel much more comfortable too. The 747’s upper deck, that formed its distinctive hump, became the most coveted place in the sky. More than 1,500 of the planes have been delivered over the past five decades. Not many people, even the geekiest of aviation enthusiasts, can distinguish an Airbus A330 jet from a Boeing 777–two of the jumbo’s modern successors–when they soar overhead. But almost every traveller can recognise the 747’s hump. This iconic sight, however, is getting rarer. With four gas-guzzling engines, the 747 is much less fuel-efficient than modern twin-engine rivals such as the A330 or the 777. That makes it costlier to operate–a problem in an airline industry where margins are often too thin. Yet the real surprise for Boeing is how successful it was. It was originally just meant to be a cargo-carrying jet; supersonic airliners were thought to be the future of aviation when the 747 was born. The triumph of it as a passenger aircraft—and the commercial failure of supersonic jets such as Concorde—came as a pleasant surprise for Boeing. The purpose of its hump in the original design was not to wow business-class passengers but to raise the cockpit above the fuselage, so cargo the full size of its diameter could be fitted in. And there is still some demand for new ones for exactly that purpose. All of the 24 jumbos left in Boeing’s orderbook are destined for cargo carriers. The 747 is on the wane as a passenger aircraft as airlines retire their fleets. But it is far from dead yet."
625,"A group of nine House Republicans from California is calling on the Obama administration to reject a request from the state to allow people in the country illegally to purchase health insurance through ObamaCare. The lawmakers, led by Rep.

ObamaCare specifically bans people in the country illegally from enrolling, the lawmakers point out. “This brazen attempt to circumvent the will of Congress adds insult to injury for the millions of Americans who have already been aggrieved and misled by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” the lawmakers write.  California’s request stems from a measure signed into law earlier this month by Gov. Jerry Brown (D).  The Obama administration has not indicated whether it will approve the request.

626,"Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran and other self-made millionaires and billionaires didn't simply happen upon success. They made smart decisions and investments along the way, all of which helped them build wealth and which could help you, too. There are no guarantees that these investments will make you rich. Still, according to people with experience, here are five of the smartest things you can do with your money. If you're investing your money in the stock market, ""never invest in a business you cannot understand,"" says the self-made billionaire and investing legend. Stick with companies and industries you're familiar with because, at the end of the day, ""risk comes from not knowing what you're doing,"" Buffett says. When the real estate queen rented her first apartment in 1973, she collected a $360 commission check, ran over to Bergdorf Goodman and ""blew it on a new coat,"" she says. ""It was the smartest thing I could have done with the money because, in it, I felt powerful."" Corcoran, who now stars on ABC's ""Shark Tank,"" was onto something. As research shows, dressing for success can work: When employees wear nicer clothes, they can be more likely to achieve more. The self-made millionaire and personal finance expert says buying a home is an escalator to wealth. What's more, ""if millennials don't buy a home, their chances of actually having any wealth in this country are little to none,"" Bach says. ""The average homeowner to this day is 38 times wealthier than a renter."" ""The key to success in business is all about people, people, people,"" the billionaire entrepreneur writes on his blog. ""It should go without saying, if you look after your people, your customers and bottom line will be rewarded too."" In fact, ""the most important skills I had to learn to be successful were people skills,"" 67-year-old tells CNBC Make It. As for how to develop solid interpersonal skills, paying attention and being a great listener are key. The best investment anyone can make is ""paying off your credit cards,"" says the self-made billionaire. ""Paying off whatever debt you have."" The money saved on interest by not having debt is better than any return you could get by investing your money, he says: ""Whatever interest rate you have — it might be a student loan with a 7 percent interest rate — if you pay off that loan, you're making 7 percent. That's your immediate return, which is a lot safer than trying to pick a stock or trying to pick real estate, or whatever it may be."""
627,"* Wall St shares recover from Trump’s Russia woes, but dollar hurt * Fed’s Brainard suggests rate hike depends on inflation * Canadian dollar off 10-month high ahead of likely BoC rate hike * Oil extends gains on U.S. production fall, stockpiles data * European shares seen 0.2-0.3 pct higher at open By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, July 12 (Reuters) - Asian shares gained on Wednesday after Wall Street managed to weather a fresh twist in the controversy over U.S. President Donald Trump’s alleged connection with Russia, while investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s comments. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.3 percent. Japan’s yen-sensitive Nikkei slid 0.4 percent on the yen’s gains but MSCI’s dollar-denominated Japan index gained 0.5 percent. European shares are expected to rise, with spread-betters looking to gains of 0.3 percent in Germany’s DAX and Britain’s FTSE, and a 0.2 percent rise in France’s CAC at the opening. U.S. stocks took a brief tumble after emails disclosed Trump’s eldest son welcomed help from a Russian lawyer for his father’s 2016 election campaign against Hillary Clinton. But by the closing bell, Wall Street shares had clawed back their losses. “The e-mails look pretty bad but then again they don’t look like decisive evidence (for illegal behaviour) either. I doubt this alone would lead to a risk-off market,” said Hiroko Iwaki, senior fixed income strategist at Mizuho Securities. U.S. shares were helped in part as the Senate announced a two-week delay to its August recess to allow more time to tackle a measure that would repeal key parts of Obamacare, as well as pursue other legislative priorities. Still, it remained unclear whether U.S. Senate Republicans have the votes to pass the measure or even what form it would finally take. On the other hand, the dollar failed to recover after the damage suffered from the new twist in the Trump campaign’s alleged links with Russia. The euro vaulted to a 14-month high of $1.14895 in Asian trade. The dollar also lost steam against the yen, which had been under renewed pressure following Friday’s bond-buying by the Bank of Japan which highlighted divergent monetary polices between the two countries. The U.S. currency dropped 0.4 percent to 113.46 yen, slipping from a four-month high of 114.495 yen touched on Tuesday. The Canadian dollar stood at C$1.2907 per dollar, near Friday’s 10-month peak of C$1.2860 as investors brace for a likely rate hike by the Bank of Canada, its first tightening since 2010, later in the day. The move would make Canada the first to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in removing the monetary stimulus poured into the global economy, with the European Central Bank and the Bank of England also seen moving in that direction in coming months. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies was hovering at 95.58, just above its nine-month low of 95.47 plumbed at the end of June. U.S. Treasuries yields stayed below their recent peaks, with the 10-year yield at 2.352 percent, compared with 2.398 percent marked on Friday, its loftiest level in almost two months. Ahead of Fed Chair Yellen’s testimony to Congress on the state of the U.S. economy from 1400 GMT, two of her colleagues cited low wage growth and muted inflation as reasons for caution on further interest rate increases. Fed Governor Lael Brainard embraced the plan to reduce the balance sheet “soon,” but suggested her support for any future rate increases will depend in part on how inflation shapes up. Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said he finds it hard to believe that the U.S. economy is in danger of overheating when wage growth is so low. Traders trimmed expectations of a rate hike by the end of the year, with dollar interest rate futures pricing in about a 55 percent chance compared to about 60 percent earlier, while most investors expect the Fed to decide to start shrinking its balance sheet in September. “Yellen has indicated after the June policy meeting, in the clearest way as possible by her standards, that she plans to start balance sheet reduction and there will be one more rate hike this year. Since then, there’s been no big changes in the economy,” said Tomoaki Shishido, senior market economist at Nomura Securities. “I would think the U.S. CPI data on Friday could be more important. If the Fed’s assessment that the softness in CPI between February and May is transitory, the Fed will go ahead with its plan. If that’s not the case, some Fed policymakers will want to revise that plan,” he added. Reaction was largely muted to a story by Politico that Trump is increasingly unlikely to nominate Yellen next year for a second term, and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is the leading candidate to succeed her. Oil prices extended gains from the previous day as the U.S. government cut its crude production outlook for next year and as fuel inventories plunged. U.S. crude futures rose 1.8 percent to $45.83 per barrel, extending their recovery from Monday’s near two-week low of $43.65. Brent futures gained 1.5 percent to $48.25 per barrel. Both contracts have risen above their 50 percent retracement of their fall between mid-last week and Monday. Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Jacqueline Wong"

629,"* Shares around the world rattled by Apple revenue warning * Wall Street further hurt by weak U.S. factory data * Yen soars against dollar; Treasuries, gold rise (Updates to late afternoon in U.S. markets) By April Joyner NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - A revenue warning from Apple Inc rocked equity markets around the globe on Thursday as concerns over a damaging China-U.S. trade battle and its impact on world economic growth boosted assets considered safer investments, such as bonds and the Japanese yen. Technology stocks led a selloff in Asian, European and U.S. stock markets after Apple, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China, cut its revenue forecast for the first time in nearly 12 years. Apple’s U.S.-listed shares were last down 9.7 percent. That heightened concerns that sluggish global growth may be reflected in the United States, where corporate earnings season is set to kick off in a few weeks. Survey data from the Institute for Supply Management showed U.S. factory activity slowed more than expected in December, sending stocks on Wall Street lower. Treasury yields fell and prices surged after the U.S. manufacturing activity data, extending overnight losses prompted by the Apple warning that sent investors fleeing to safe-haven instruments. The two-year Treasury yield briefly dropped below 2.4 percent to reach parity with the federal funds effective rate for the first time since 2008. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 29/32 in price to yield 2.5605 percent, from 2.661 percent late on Wednesday. “The Apple pre-announcement has roiled the market ever since the news came out,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “People upset about the uncertainty surrounding global markets right now are looking for safety in Treasuries.” In the U.S. equity market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 610.35 points, or 2.61 percent, to 22,735.89, the S&P 500 lost 55.63 points, or 2.22 percent, to 2,454.4 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 184.36 points, or 2.77 percent, to 6,481.58. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.24 percent. Apple’s news also unsettled the currency markets, with the safe-haven yen climbing against the dollar. The dollar was last 1.02 percent lower against the yen at 107.76 yen. Earlier, in what some market watchers called a “flash crash,” the yen rose as much as 4.4 percent versus the dollar after a flurry of automated orders triggered a massive move in Asia, where trade was thin with Japanese participants still away for the New Year holiday. The dollar index, measuring the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was last down 0.5 percent. The euro rose 0.44 percent against the dollar to $1.1392. Keeping with the risk-off theme, gold prices hit a 6-1/2-month peak. Spot gold last added 0.7 percent to $1,293.24 an ounce. Copper prices dropped to an 18-month low and ended 1.8 percent lower at $5,736 a tonne. Yet Brent crude futures rose $1.04, or 1.89 percent, to settle at $55.95 a barrel. U.S. crude futures rose 55 cents to $47.09 a barrel, a 1.18 percent gain. Reporting by April Joyner; Additional reporting by Andrew

630,"New York (CNN Business)Hudson's Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, has agreed to be taken private in the latest upheaval to hit the retail sector. The Canadian-based retailer said Monday it will buy back the remaining 43% of shares it doesn't already own at a price of $10.30 Canadian dollars per share [US $7.86], a 9% increase from the $9.45 Canadian dollars per share [US $7.21] the group offered in June. Hudson's Bay (HBAYF) shares surged 6% on the news in early Monday trading. The deal is a 65% premium over Bay's closing stock price of $6.20 Canadian dollars [$4.74 US] from the original offer in June.  Canadian regulators and shareholders need to formally approve the deal later this year. The increased bid might appease Catalyst Capital Group, a group of shareholders that previously called the June offer ""inadequate."" CNN Business' request for comment was not immediately returned.  David Leigh, the chair of Hudson Bay's board, said the company accepted the deal after conducting a ""thorough evaluation"" of the offer and other alternatives. He said in a release that the board is ""confident that this transaction represents the best path forward"" for the struggling retailer.  The company has been busy streamlining its operations this past year in an effort to boost its prospects. Going private could help turn things around without the the pressure of the public markets and investors.  In August, Hudson Bay's sold off Lord & Taylor for $75 million to Le Tote, Inc., a fashion rental subscription service. It received an equity position in Le Tote as part of the deal, in addition to the modest cash payment. It also continues to own the real estate and leases associated with the remaining 38 Lord & Taylor stores.  The company announced in September it was shuttering 15 Hudson's Bay stores across the Netherlands. It still operates nearly 100 Hudson's Bay department stores across Canada. Competition and changing customer habits, including using fashion rental services, have rocked the retail industry. Earlier this year, Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy, shuttering some 2,500 stores. Barneys filed for bankruptcy in August, as did Forever 21 a month later. Retailers closed some 7,000 stores in the first half of 2019, according to a report by BDO USA, a professional services firm. "
